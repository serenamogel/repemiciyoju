However, by Demon Slayer‘s seventh episode, they eventually come across demon-overlord and -progenitor Muzan Kibutsuji, who happens to be the responsible party. After that mystery is cleared up, the big one that remains for a while is why he did it.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Why, indeed? What reason did Demon Slayer‘s big bad have for offing most of the Kamado family and turning Nezuko into a demon? Was it just a random attack, or was a specific purpose involved? Does he have some special use for the black-haired, pink-eyed demon? And if so, what is it?</p><h2 id=h-muzan-s-reason-for-turning-nezuko data-injectable=false>Muzan’s reason for turning Nezuko</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Muzan-as-a-boy.jpg><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>It turns out that Demon Slayer‘s arch-villain started out life as a sickly boy who was always at the point of death. However, his health problems were “fixed” after he was turned into a demon in a medical experiment gone wrong. That being said, notwithstanding the myriad of abilities Muzan’s demonic state afforded him, along with his lack of concern about the less-than-ideal side effects (such as now having a craving for human flesh), he lacked the ability to walk in the sun.</p><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>To attain sun tolerance and hence, an ideal immortal body, Demon Slayer‘s arch-villain knows that he needs to consume The Blue Spider Lily flower (a mysterious ingredient required to complete his medication, which he murdered his doctor before he could receive) or a sun-tolerant demon. Thus, desiring to become a perfect being with no hang-ups, he keeps creating more demons by feeding human victims his corrupted blood, hoping that at least one of them will help him find the desired plant or prove capable of withstanding the sunlight.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>Tragically for him, the flower only blooms during the daytime two or three times a year for a short period of time, making the creation of a demon who can handle sun exposure his best bet.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=false>Sadly, the Kamado family were random victims of this relentless quest. Unfortunately for the demon lord, he left the residence assuming they had all died as experimental failures, leaving newly awakened (and eventually sun-tolerant) demon Nezuko in Tanjiro’s safe hands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7JllJ6xbrnUs5inZZuer7bA0q6homWkqr%2Bvec2esa6jn2K4ornAnaZmoZ6pvG6tjJ2cpqeeYq61edOhnGarpJa%2FtXnOn2SdnZ2ku26%2Fy5qwnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-cookies.html><span>←</span><span>Best Cookies: Best Chocolate Chip Cookies and More</span></a>
