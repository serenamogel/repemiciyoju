The shooting that took place in the early hours of Sunday morning in front of a strip club in Melbourne is being investigated by the police as possibly being a targeted incident. Near the intersection of King Street in the central business district, emergency personnel were dispatched to Lonsdale Street after receiving reports that a man had been hurt shortly after 4 o’clock in the morning.</p><p>The man, who was in his late teens or early twenties, was transported to the hospital with injuries that were not considered to be life-threatening. It was reported to the police that a possible gunshot was heard before to the discovery of the man. According to the police from the Armed Crime Squad, the individual has not been open with information regarding the crime itself. There is a cordon around the location, and the police are conducting interviews with witnesses who are present at the site.<br>The police have stated that they are still investigating the specific circumstances surrounding the shooting, but they are treating it as a targeted attack. Chris Murray, a detective inspector, stated that the police are currently analyzing surveillance material in order to piece together what took place. “The altercation occurred inside the venue and the shooting occurred immediately outside the venue,” stated the prosecutor.</p><p>We’ll keep an open mind and try to establish the identity of the offender and bring them before the courts very quickly.” The police have stated that there is no risk to the public’s safety at this time. “The offender fled the scene, there was no subsequent altercation with any other patrons, so you can draw the conclusion that the altercation was just between those two individuals,” Detective Inspector Murray explained to reporters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKiYnrluv8eemGankp7Btq3RsmStoJVivKeyyJycZqiipL2mvtOyZKaZo6mys3nHmqpmq5GZubp5z5qqrJ2UYq64rdho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./not-just-a-miracle-ladybug-cat-noir-continue-their-domination-of-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>Not just a miracle: Ladybug &amp;amp; Cat Noir continue their domination of Netflix</span></a>
