His early days involved playing for a variety of bands, including The Dynamics, The Medallions, King Bees, and Strawberry Ripple. His formal introduction to Aerosmith occurred in 1970 when he joined the band and signed with Columbia Records. Their albums “Toys in the Attic” and “Rocks” brought them global recognition, solidifying their positions in the music industry and contributing significantly to Kramer’s wealth.</p><p>Over the years, Aerosmith’s career witnessed ups and downs, but they managed to make a striking comeback with the release of “Permanent Vacation” in 1987, followed by the blockbuster success of “Get a Grip” in 1993. The band’s widespread fame was further propelled by their music videos which garnered numerous awards, and their song “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” further solidified their place in the music industry.</p><p>Although the band faced challenges, such as Kramer’s health issues during the “Let Rock Rule” tour in 2014, they have persevered, with Joey returning to the group after a brief hiatus.
