However, she has starred in a number of respectable films and TV series outside of that, such as 2018’s cerebral sci-fi flick Annihilation and 2016’s Deepwater Horizon. If those films were the first hints at the actress’ action star destiny, perhaps the Robert Rodriquez-directed Spy Kids reboot will be the final catalyst to launch her to superhero glory. In fact, it is the type of role Rodriguez herself has said she’d love to try (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>):</p><p>“I would love to be a superhero—that’s all I want to do is play a superhero […] And let’s be real, I could kick some [butt]. We all know I could kick some [butt].”</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>That interview was way back in 2015, and yet Rodriguez’s star has only continued to shine, as her involvement in Armageddon surely indicates. As our sister site, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mary Sue</a>, has pointed out, Rodriguez even came up with her own pitch for the setting of a superhero movie she would love to be involved in, taking place in medieval times in pre-colonial South America. As she explained in response to a question about superheroes during the red-carpet premiere of Annihilation:</p><p>“I think it would be about Christopher Columbus coming over, the migration of the Spaniards, and the influence of the mixes [of people] in South America and in the Caribbean. That’s were my superhero movies would lay, like the 1400 or 1500s.”</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>In retrospect, it honestly hits that same flavor of a superhuman dealing with the effects of colonization that we saw with the origin of Tenoch Huerta’s Namor character from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. If anything, that just goes to show how ahead of the curve Rodriguez truly was, considering her remarks were from 2018.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>In terms of female Latinx characters she could potentially play in the MCU, that could easily come in the form of one of Professor Xavier’s newest disciples, Tempest, a character that sports insect wings and spits acid. She could also play Spider-Girl, White Tiger, or the healer and force field-wielder Dr. Cecilia Reyes, among many other options listed on Marvel’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>In the world of DC, some potential heroes she could play that emphasize her Hispanic heritage include the feline-like mutant Wildcat, the helmet-wielding Aztek, and seasoned police detective Renee Montoya of Batman: The Animated Series fame, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBR</a> pointed out. Let’s not forget one of the most powerful heroes of all that she could portray: a Green Lantern herself named Jessica Cruz.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, we can enjoy seeing Rodriguez in Spy Kids: Armageddon on Netflix on Sept. 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Clo2ahXayur8CMraZmnJ9itrR5z6WYsmWRYsC2vMSrn56qn2KwsMHLnWSgoZ6WerO7w6ugoK2Vr3q0vNhmoqKco2Kus7nAoJydnJ%2BjerO7y55krJ2kYrWmvoyup2aen6d6orqMppquZZ%2BneqWv1Ganq52dnrKzsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-tater-tot-casserole.html><span>←</span><span>The BEST Tater Tot Casserole</span></a>
