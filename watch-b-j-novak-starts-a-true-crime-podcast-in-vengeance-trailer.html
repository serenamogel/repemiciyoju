When he’s roped into an investigation surrounding the possible murder of the woman, Manalowitz puts his repertoire to good use by starting a conspiracy theory podcast so that listeners can avoid the pain of truth for a bit longer. The woman’s death, however, might not be as unlikely a possibility as he once assumed. Also starring is Issa Rae, Ashton Kutcher, Boyd Holbrook, J. Smith-Cameron, and Dove Cameron.</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>The trailer is packed to the brim with gags, nonsense, and second-hand embarrassment, teeing up Vengeance as one of the funniest films ever put out by Blumhouse, largely known for producing works in the horror genre, such as Jordan Peele’s Get Out and Us, Universal’s The Invisible Man, and 2018’s Halloween. Novak is much more familiar with the comedy scene, having portrayed Ryan Howard in the celebrated sitcom The Office. His film credits include Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds, and the Andrew Garfield-led The Amazing Spider-Man 2.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=87 data-injectable=false>Vengeance will release in theatres across the United States on July 29 later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9aaq5ygXZd6q3nNqK2ao12owaK%2B06xkmmWkp8KmecKroKadXaW8pa%2FArKtmoZ5iw6a6xp6Yp5uVYsGzrcilnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-brotherhood-of-the-wolf-2002.html><span>←</span><span>The Brotherhood Of The Wolf movie review (2002)</span></a>
