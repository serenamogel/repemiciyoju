The sender's game also sends a bit (0 or 1) to tell the recipient whether they're supposed to receive a decoration; if so and they already have that decoration, they will get the item that the sender chose instead.<a href=#>[3]</a></p><p>Choosing a specific item or decoration gift to send occurs in two stages. First, the game selects a set from which the gift will come. Then, it uses a part of the sending player's <a href=# title="Trainer ID number">Trainer ID number</a> to determine which gift from that set to send. (Below, bit 0 refers to the least significant bit of the Trainer ID and bit 15 refers to the most significant bit.

For rare and very rare gifts, the gift is determined solely by a bit or bits from the sender's Trainer ID. The bits used differ slightly for items and decorations.</p><h4><span id=In_Pok.C3.A9mon_Stadium_2></span><span class=mw-headline id=In_Pokémon_Stadium_2>In Pokémon Stadium 2</span></h4><p>When a player receives a Mystery Gift, the game chooses two possible gifts: first an item, then a decoration.

Due to the way the game <a href=#>generates random numbers</a>, not all combinations of random values are possible. In the tables below, "theoretical" indicates the rates if the random numbers are truly random, while "practical" indicates the actual outcomes that are possible from the output of the random number generator.</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Item_gift_set>Item gift set</span></h5><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><th rowspan=2>Random number</th><th rowspan=2>Range</th><th rowspan=2>Gift set</th><th colspan=2>Overall rate (approx.)</th></tr><tr><th>Theoretical</th><th>Practical</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>1st</td><td>25-255</td><td>Common</td><td>90.2%</td><td>90.2% (231/256)</td></tr><tr><td>0-24</td><td class=c colspan=3><i>N/A (pick a 2nd number)</i></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>2nd</td><td>50-255</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>7.9%</td><td>8.2% (21/256)</td></tr><tr><td>0-49</td><td class=c colspan=3><i>N/A (pick a 3rd number)</i></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>3rd</td><td>50-255</td><td>Rare</td><td>1.5%</td><td>1.2% (3/256)</td></tr><tr><td>0-49</td><td>Very rare</td><td>0.4%</td><td>0.4% (1/256)</td></tr></tbody></table><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Decoration_gift_set>Decoration gift set</span></h5><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><th rowspan=2>Random number</th><th rowspan=2>Range</th><th rowspan=2>Gift set</th><th colspan=2>Overall rate (approx.)</th></tr><tr><th>Theoretical</th><th>Practical</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>1st</td><td>36-255</td><td>Common</td><td>85.9%</td><td>87.1% (223/256)</td></tr><tr><td>0-35</td><td class=c colspan=3><i>N/A (pick a 2nd number)</i></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>2nd</td><td>72-255</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>10.1%</td><td>9.8% (25/256)</td></tr><tr><td>0-71</td><td class=c colspan=3><i>N/A (pick a 3rd number)</i></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>3rd</td><td>72-255</td><td>Rare</td><td>2.8%</td><td>2.7% (7/256)</td></tr><tr><td>0-71</td><td>Very rare</td><td>1.1%</td><td>0.4% (1/256)</td></tr></tbody></table><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Gift_selection>Gift selection</span></h5><p>Once a gift set is selected, the game will select a specific gift. For common and uncommon gifts, the game picks a random number from 0-7 or 0-3 and combines that with a specific bit from the receiver's Trainer ID to determine which gift to send. (Once again, the <a href=#>cyclic random numbers</a> will constrain the practical outcomes, but this mainly affects uncommon items, with NES/Nintendo64 being slightly more common and Bulbasaur Doll/Squirtle Doll being slightly less common for decorations, while Revive/Great Ball and Super Repel/Max Repel are slightly more common than the others for items. The table below portrays ideal outcomes.) For rare and very rare gifts, the gift is determined solely by a bit or bits from the receiver's Trainer ID. The bits used differ slightly for items and decorations.</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Pseudorandom_number_generator_limitations>Pseudorandom number generator limitations</span></h5><p>Due to the way the <a href=# title="Pseudorandom number generation">pseudorandom number generator</a> in Pokémon Stadium 2 works, the random numbers used for Mystery Gift selection fall into a cycle of 256 values (none repeating).<a href=#>[4]</a> This essentially means that numbers after the first are not random: they cannot have their full range of possible values. Since decorations are checked immediately after items, decorations are also dependent on the value that was used when starting the item check. As a consequence, some items or decorations above may have rates slightly higher than their ideal rates (if all numbers were truly random); this most strongly affects uncommon items and decorations. It also affects two decorations that should be obtainable but are not.</p><p>The very rare gift set for decorations actually contains Big Lapras Doll, Surf Pikachu Doll, Tentacool Doll, and Pikachu Bed, but the last two are unobtainable. Upon reaching the very rare gift set for decorations, the game actually picks a fourth random number between 0 and 255 and performs the following logic. <a href=#>[5]</a></p><p>Because of the constraints of the random number generator, the sequence of numbers needed to arrive at the Tentacool Doll or Pikachu Bed outcomes (from the start of the Mystery Gift routine) will never occur. The only sequence which reaches the very rare decoration outcome is <code>14, 21, 112, 15, 34, 25</code> (<code>14, 21, 112</code> produces a rare item outcome, which is followed by <code>15, 34, 25</code> which produces a very rare decoration), which is followed by <code>164</code> (Big Lapras Doll or Surf Pikachu Doll).</p><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.2660550458716><tr><td></td></tr><tr readability=2.8695652173913><td width=425px colspan=2><b>This video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span id=In_Pok.C3.A9mon_Pikachu_2_GS></span><span class=mw-headline id=In_Pokémon_Pikachu_2_GS>In Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS</span></h4><p>The following is a list of items obtainable in <a href=# title="Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS">Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS</a> and their cost in <a href=# title=Watt>Watts</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_III>Generation III</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Mystery_Gift>Mystery Gift</span></h4><table align=center><tbody readability=3><tr readability=6><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.<br>Reason: Needs info on Wonder Cards and Wonder News.
