Who Was Phyllis Schlafly?Conservative firebrand Phyllis Schlafly has been credited with swaying public opinion and preventing the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution. During the fight to ratify the ERA, Schlafly argued that the amendment would undermine stay-at-home mothers while forcing women into military service, expanding access to abortion, and leading to the legalization of same-sex marriage. Following the defeat of the ERA, Schlafly remained a prominent conservative figure who argued against sex education, abortion and more."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

During the fight to ratify the ERA, Schlafly argued that the amendment would undermine stay-at-home mothers while forcing women into military service, expanding access to abortion, and leading to the legalization of same-sex marriage. Following the defeat of the ERA, Schlafly remained a prominent conservative figure who argued against sex education, abortion and more.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly was born as Phyllis McAlpin Stewart on August 15, 1924, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Odile Dodge Stewart and John Bruce Stewart. During the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Great Depression" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Great Depression</a> Schlafly's father lost his job. Though he would find occasional work, it was Schlafly's mother who supported the family, which consisted of Schlafly and a younger sister. Odile worked as a department store saleswoman, teacher and librarian. However, these economic struggles didn't alter the family's Republicanism or make them fans of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/new-deal data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New Deal" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">New Deal</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly attended the Academy of the Sacred Heart for high school, then won a scholarship to Maryville College. Yet she soon opted for a transfer to the more academically challenging Washington University. Attending college during <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War II</a> meant Schlafly could work at night testing ammunition in order to earn tuition money. Following her 1944 graduation, she earned a master's in government from Radcliffe College.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While working in St. Louis in 1949, Schlafly penned an article for a bank's newsletter. Attorney John Fred Schlafly Jr. appreciated the piece and came to meet its author. After overcoming his surprise that it had been written by a woman, he quickly fell in love. The couple wed on October 20, 1949.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1978 Schlafly received a law degree from Washington University. Her husband's initial disapproval had prompted her to withdraw her application, but after he gave his permission — he believed that knowing the law would help in her fight against the ERA — Schlafly was able to pursue this course of study.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Stop ERA Campaign</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In December 1971, a friend asked Schlafly to speak about the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/equal-rights-amendment-passed-by-congress data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Equal Rights Amendment" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, a proposed constitutional amendment that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. Up to this point, the conservative Schlafly had been more focused on the threat of Communism, but she did some research and became an ERA opponent. In 1972, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/equal-rights-amendment-failure-phyllis-schlafly data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she formed the group Stop ERA" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she formed the group Stop ERA</a> — Stop was an acronym for Stop Taking Our Privileges — to halt the amendment's ratification.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/17/archives/normally-proper-gop-women-come-out-fighting-over-era.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=described data-vars-ga-product-id=9c5df1c1-03ad-44df-ad70-a7d92dd13f17 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/17/archives/normally-proper-gop-women-come-out-fighting-over-era.html data-product-url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/17/archives/normally-proper-gop-women-come-out-fighting-over-era.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F1976%2F08%2F17%2Farchives%2Fnormally-proper-gop-women-come-out-fighting-over-era.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e44bf8b2-4e86-41b5-ac5a-715e30586b8e class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">described</a> the ERA as "an attack on the wife and homemaker" that would subject women to the military draft and keep them from receiving alimony. She also argued that the ERA would result in gay rights, unisex bathrooms and the government paying for abortions. Schlafly was able to tap into a backlash among housewives who thought their choices were being devalued and religious conservatives who were wary of changes to traditional family structures. Many of the people Schlafly worked with were also motivated by opposition to the 1973 Supreme Court decision in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/a44120513/jane-roe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Roe class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roe</a> v. Wade, which legalized abortion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Momentum seemed to be in the ERA's favor when Schlafly began to act. The amendment had support from both Democrats and Republicans, and both houses of Congress passed the ERA by large margins in 1972. A year later, 30 states had ratified the ERA, meaning that only eight more needed to do so in order for it to become a part of the Constitution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To prevent ratification, Schlafly coordinated efforts to sway state legislatures. She tutored ERA opponents in talking points and had anti-ERA women give homemade bread or pies, symbolizing traditional homemaking, to legislators. She also debated feminists who supported the amendment. Schlafly's debate partners were often angered by what they saw as her lies about the ERA. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/betty-friedan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Betty Friedan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Betty Friedan</a>, author of The Feminine Mystique, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/firebrand data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Schlafly" data-vars-ga-product-id=6ed63430-2e3d-44dd-ac8c-6d9785b8c237 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/firebrand data-product-url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/firebrand data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2005%2F11%2F07%2Ffirebrand" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5bd68c39-bdc9-4eaf-9f69-3eef4208ba1a class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">told Schlafly</a> during one of these face-offs, "I'd like to burn you at the stake. I consider you a traitor to your sex."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 1977, a National Women's Conference was held in Houston. Attendees voiced support for the ERA and discussed other issues such as reproductive choices, gay rights and nuclear disarmament. At the same time Schlafly coordinated an opposition Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally. The event welcomed at least 15,000 attendees, with overflow crowds, at Houston's Astro Arena. The strength of this gathering was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/video/makers-women-who-make-america-stop-era/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=considered class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">considered</a> a turning point in Schlafly's anti-ERA campaign. In January 1977, Indiana had ratified the amendment, becoming the 35th state to do so — but no other state followed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Congress passed a bill extending the deadline for ratification from March 22, 1979, to June 30, 1982, but the ERA still fell short of the required state ratifications by the second deadline. In fact, five state legislatures had voted to rescind their earlier ratifications (though the legality of these rescissions was unclear). Schlafly celebrated her win with a party at a hotel in Washington, D.C., and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/phyllis-schlafly-a-conservative-activist-has-died-at-age-92/2016/09/05/513420e2-73bc-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=announced class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">announced</a> the ERA was "dead for now and forever in this century."</p><img alt="Phyllis Schlafly leads members opposed to the equal rights amendment in a song" title="Phyllis Schlafly leads members opposed to the equal rights amendment in a song" width=6813 height=4701 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/phyllis-schlafly-gettyimages-933169356.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images</span><p>Phyllis Schlafly leads members opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment in a song about the pro-ERA force’s plan for a national demonstration.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Conservative Beliefs</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly was a staunch conservative before and after her anti-ERA campaign. After graduate school, she worked for the American Enterprise Association, the conservative think tank that would become the American Enterprise Institute. In 1946, after returning to her hometown of St. Louis, she worked on a successful congressional campaign for a Republican candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1958 Schlafly and her husband founded a Catholic anti-Communist group, called the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/obituaries/phyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation" data-vars-ga-product-id=053516bf-40ce-4a92-b68c-86aa7e7bf66b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/obituaries/phyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html data-product-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/obituaries/phyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F09%2F06%2Fobituaries%2Fphyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3ca3b989-91f0-49b8-bfd9-52befe2c8e1d class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation</a>, in honor of a Hungarian priest who had been persecuted by his country's Communist regime. She supported nuclear testing, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.kcur.org/post/obituary-phyllis-schlafly-conservative-activist-thwarted-era#stream/0 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=stating class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">stating</a>, "The atomic bomb is a marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God." Schlafly also unleashed vitriol on politicians, including Republicans, whom she considered weak on national defense.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her conservative views were shared in "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www2.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/OralHistory/illinoisstatecraft/era/Documents/SchlaflyPhyllis/Schlafly_Phy_4FNL.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Phyllis Schlafly Report" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Phyllis Schlafly Report</a>," a subscription newsletter she launched in 1967. In 1975, Schlafly's Stop ERA became the Eagle Forum. Following the ERA's defeat, this group continued to advocate for conservative causes. Schlafly also used television appearances, newspaper columns and radio segments to decry abortion, sex education, gay rights, pornography and immigration reform.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From 1952 until 2016, Schlafly attended every Republican National Convention. She supported conservative Republicans such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barry-goldwater data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barry Goldwater" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barry Goldwater</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ronald Reagan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ronald Reagan</a>. Schlafly's anti-ERA stand and vocal support for conservative causes are thought to have made it possible for Reagan to win the presidency in 1980. She endorsed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a> at a rally in March 2016, a few months before she passed away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly made unsuccessful runs for Congress in 1952, 1960 and 1970. In the 1960s she was part of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women and the National Federation of Republican Women. Reagan recognized Schlafly's political skills — once <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/conservative-activist-phyllis-schlafly-dies/article_08b63543-2a9b-5e96-bbc0-91367561fdf4.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=describing class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">describing</a> her as "darn effective" in his diary — but the only appointment he gave her was to the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Feminism and the Role of Women</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly's national profile was tied to her vocal support for the idea that women should focus on the roles of wife and mother. However, her household featured a different division of labor. Spearheading the Stop ERA campaign and working on other conservative causes often required Schlafly to travel away from home. Her domestic life was eased by a full-time housekeeper.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Feminists <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/equal-rights-at-the-schlaflys-means-that-phyllis-shines-in-public-and-fred-reigns-at-home-vol-15-no-12/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=noticed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">noticed</a> the variance between Schlafly's public statements and her private life. Schlafly countered by stating that she had stayed home with her six children, breastfeeding them for six months and homeschooling them until the age of seven (though she ran for Congress in 1952 when her first child was a toddler).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Schlafly also characterized her political work as a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/video/makers-women-who-make-america-stop-era/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"hobby"' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"hobby"</a> that was only undertaken with her husband's permission.

In a 1978 interview, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/4480208/phyllis-schlafly-election-history/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she stated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she stated</a>, "When I fill out applications, I put down 'Mother' as my occupation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As evidence of her rejection of the women's rights movement of the 1960s and '70s, Schlafly <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-phyllis-schlafly-snap-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=declared class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">declared</a> that to her the title "Ms." meant misery.

The self-published book sold three million copies.
