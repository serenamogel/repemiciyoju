Designed by Victor David Brenner, it was the first coin that presented a portrait and the first that included the motto "In God We Trust." On the reverse side, two wheat heads flank the denomination and the words "United States of America," while atop sits the Latin phrase "E Pluribus Unum," which translates as "One out of many." For no particular reason, the Lincoln portrait is the only presidential portrait that faces to the right on a coin.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nickel - Thomas Jefferson</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As part of a competition held by the U.S. Mint, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/thomas-jefferson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Jefferson class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jefferson</a> Nickel was designed by winner Felix Schlag and issued out 1938, replacing the Buffalo Nickel.

Designed by Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, the Roosevelt dime featured the president's portrait with the word "Liberty" on the left and "In God We Trust" sitting below.

The bicentennial committee originally wanted a temporary Washington half dollar issued in place of the Walking Liberty half dollar, but once Congress got involved, it scrapped the half dollar plans and instead, requested the Washington quarter permanently replace the Standing Liberty quarter. Although the committee vied for sculptor Laura Gardin Fraser's design of Washington's portrait, Treasury Secretary Andrew W.

By then much of the design components of the $1 bill were already set in place — its color, borders, phraseology — as they had long been in use. As one of the oldest U.S. currency designs still being used today, the $1 bill features an image of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/george-washington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Washington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Washington</a> (based on Gilbert Stuart's Athenaeum Portrait) on the obverse, while the reverse shows the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-adopts-the-great-seal-of-the-united-states data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Great Seal of the United States" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Great Seal of the United States</a>. The design of the former was introduced in 1963, while the latter dates back to 1935 and was used primarily for the purpose of avoiding counterfeits. This front and back version was used when the $1 bill changed from being issued as a Silver Certificate to an official Federal Reserve Note.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">$5 Bill - Abraham Lincoln</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/abraham-lincoln data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Abraham Lincoln's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Abraham Lincoln's</a> portrait first debuted on the $5 bill in 1914, seven other men secured a transitory spot on the denomination, ranging from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/alexander-hamilton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alexander Hamilton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alexander Hamilton</a> and Chief Onepapa to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/james-garfield data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Garfield" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Garfield</a>.

The bill's most current image of Lincoln is based on Mathew Brady's portrait of the president in 1864. In 2008 the $5 bill debuted its new high tech redesign. Its new front includes the use of the color purple, an imprint of The Great Seal of the United States to the right of Lincoln's face and a band of stars. On the back, the bold purple "5" watermark at the bottom right stands most conspicuously, along with a sprinkle of yellow 5s to the top right, among its security features.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">$10 Bill - Alexander Hamilton</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Prior to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/alexander-hamilton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alexander Hamilton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alexander Hamilton</a> being featured on the $10 bill, a variety of notable figures predated his famous face, including politician Daniel Webster, explorers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/meriwether-lewis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meriwether Lewis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meriwether Lewis</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/william-clark data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Clark" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">William Clark</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/andrew-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Andrew Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">President Andrew Jackson</a>. But starting in 1929, Hamilton became the statesman of choice, and the imprinted portrait you see of him today is based on a 1805 painting by John Trumbull. As the nation's first Treasury Secretary, Hamilton is one of two non-presidents to be featured on U.S. paper currency (the other is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/benjamin-franklin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Benjamin Franklin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Benjamin Franklin</a>).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Hamilton's portrait is seen on the obverse, the reverse shows the U.S. Treasury Building. Although a great deal of new technology such as watermarks and color-shifting ink have been added to the $10 bill, the biggest announcement came in 2015, when it was announced that a female figure would replace Hamilton as the new face of the denomination in 2020. However, due to the popularity of Broadway's musical Hamilton, the government reversed its decision and has kept Hamilton on the bill.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">$20 Bill - Andrew Jackson</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For a man who wanted to abolish paper money, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/andrew-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Andrew Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">President Andrew Jackson</a> would've found it quite ironic that his face sits on the $20 bill — let alone any bill for that matter.
