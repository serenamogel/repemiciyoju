They should be refreshing, invigorating, and bursting with nostalgic flavors. The mere thought of the best popsicle should have you itching to hop on a bike and ride to your nearest convenience store just to pick an ice pop out of the cooler.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you missed our time-stamped, <a href=# rel=noopener>day-in-the-life of a Sporked taste-tester</a> video, people have a lot of opinions about the correct way to open popsicles. As they should. One of our very unhinged Sporked writers (okay, fine, it was me, Ariana, hi!) opened them like a toddler still getting used to the idea of opposable thumbs. But you know what? There was method to her madness. When you open the popsicle from the top-down, you get to keep the wrapper around the stick to catch sticky drips before they reach your hands. However, there is no excuse for the way she popped them out of their wrappers. Unnamed Sporked writer, if you’re reading this (or hey, maybe writing this?), just tear the wrappers open next time. Or use scissors.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, back to what really matters: finding the best popsicles at the grocery store. Obviously, popsicles are pretty diverse desserts. They come in various shapes, flavors, and sizes (not that size matters—it’s all about how you use it, or something). Going into this second taste test, we were intent on including the best sugar free popsicles, the best ice pops, and even the best gourmet popsicles to keep on hand during the hot summer months. Since popsicles typically come in big boxes, here are the brands actually worth taking up space in your freezer. So without further ado, let’s pop off, shall we?</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#da9db1></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Fruity Freezer Pop: Deebee’s Organics SuperFruit Freezie Freezer Pops" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DeeBees-Inset.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Fruity Freezer Pops</strong></p><strong><strong>Deebee’s Organics SuperFruit Freezie Freezer Pops</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Kroger</a><p>Deebee’s Organic Super Fruit Freezies are just fruit. That’s it. 100% fruit. No added sugar or preservatives or anything. They are so light and delicately flavored. When my girlfriend had the flu recently, she exclusively ate these to soothe her sore throat. We buy them in bulk at Costco, where you can get about 800 freezies for $1 (okay, not that cheap, but they are really affordable). If you need to cut down on your sugar or just want a popsicle with a more natural fruit flavor, these are the best popsicles to toss in your grocery cart. —Jordan Myrick</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Kroger</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e39294></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Sugar Free Popsicle: Popsicle Sugar Free Tropicals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sugar-free-tropicals-inset.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sugar Free</p><strong><strong>Popsicle Sugar Free Tropicals</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>We’ve gotta give it up to Popsicle Tropicals, the best <a href=#>sugar free popsicles</a> we’ve tried to date. Miraculously, these sugar free popsicles don’t taste like artificial sweeteners. They have 15 calories, zero (zero!) grams of sugar, and come in three flavors—Hawaiian Pineapple, Tropical Orange, and Caribbean Punch. Those are some seriously dangerous numbers, if you ask me. On a humid day, these are the best popsicles to pop all day long without downing boatloads of sugar. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#cc8ba2></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Most Unique Popsicle: Van Holten’s Pickle-Ice Freeze Pops" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PICKLE-POPSICLE-inset.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Unique</p><strong>Van Holten’s Pickle-Ice Freeze Pops</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I know, I know, you can’t believe pickle-flavored popsicles made the list.

They taste like you pureed a perfectly ripe mango and then froze it. The ingredient list is shockingly short—mango, lemon juice, water, and cane sugar—which helps preserve that 100% mango flavor. If you do buy these, leave them out for a few minutes before you eat them.

They are basically artisan creamsicles I’d expect to find in some trendy L.A. ice cream shop. (I would, in fact, pay over $10 for one—but you can find them for under $4 a box at Trader Joe’s.) My team might actually be a little upset with me for not putting these higher on the list, because there’s simply no faulting their bold mango flavor and soft vanilla ice cream filling.

Huh?! You just ranted and raved about TJ’s Mango Cream Bars—which are basically creamsicles!” is probably what you’re all thinking right about now. And I get it. But listen: When you think of a creamsicle, you don’t think of real fruit flavor, okay? A creamsicle should take you back to your childhood, to ice cream trucks passing by the park or ice-cold dessert coolers at a convenience store. The flavor is a little artificial in the best way—and it doesn’t melt into pureed fruit when exposed to the slightest bit of heat. Most importantly, a classic creamsicle combines orange ice and vanilla ice cream. Good Humor ice cream bars provide all of the above, and that’s why they’ve earned the coveted best creamsicle title on this list of the best popsicles. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#df86a5></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Creamy Popsicle: Jonny Pops Summer Strawberries" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_POPSICLES_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Creamy</p><strong><strong>JonnyPops Summer Strawberries & Cream Frozen Fruit Bars</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Sprouts</a><p>If you’re a little lad who loves berries and cream, well, consider these the best popsicles for you. Jonny Pops strawberry frozen fruit bars basically taste like softly churned strawberry ice cream (or strawberry froyo) in popsicle form. Not to use my least favorite word in the English dictionary, but we loved the “mouthfeel” on these little guys—they are super creamy (without melting too quickly) and riddled with strawberry bits. FYI, Jonny Pops also makes a <a href=# rel=noopener>chocolate-dipped version</a> that we weren’t able to get our hands on, but it looks particularly appealing if you’re a fan of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-chocolate-covered-strawberries/>chocolate-covered strawberries</a>. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Sprouts</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#cf8d9c></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Classic Popsicle: Outshine Fruit Bars" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BEST_POPSICLES_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>Outshine Fruit Bars</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>If you want a standard, classic fruit popsicle, Outshine is absolutely the way to go. Their fruit bars are extremely fruit forward and taste incredibly refreshing. The tangerine tastes like biting into a juicy whole piece of citrus fruit. This is the first popsicle I would reach for if I was really, really hot (temperature-wise, not looks-wise). That being said, I am really, really hot-looking and do reach for these delicious popsicles often.

I’m going to quote myself here, because I said it best: “You can take the popsicle out of the beach, but you can’t take the beach out of the popsicle.” These are virgin pina coladas in popsicle form, basically something out of your wildest lounging-poolside-at-a-fancy-resort dreams. The frozen coconut is meaty and textured with real coconut bits—which hey, might not be for everyone, so just keep that in mind! But if you’re a coconut freak, these are definitely one of the best gourmet popsicles for you. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Sprouts</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#d597bb></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Most Refreshing: Jonny Pops Organic Blue Wave Frozen Bars" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_POPSICLES_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Refreshing</p><strong>Jonny Pops Organic Blue Wave Frozen Bars</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Speaking of the beach, these ocean-blue Jonny Pops Blue Wave Frozen Bars totally scream “surf’s up.” They are mildly sweet and ridiculously refreshing. The flavor is difficult to pin down exactly—we tasted hints of both blue raspberry and lime—but that’s what makes them so interesting and addictive. Again, I’m no poet, but they taste (and look) like that first crash of an ocean wave after an hour of lounging out in the sun (minus, you know, all that salt.) Jonny Pops don’t use artificial flavors, and it makes all the difference! These are some of the best popsicles we’ve tried to date, and will be a total hit in your beach cooler. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e29b9b></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Runner Up, Best Popsicle: Popsicle Fudgsicle Original No Sugar Added Fudge Pops" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FUDGESICLE-inset.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Runner Up</p><strong>Popsicle Fudgsicle Original No Sugar Added Fudge Pops</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>I never realized that the Fudgesicles I consumed by the boxful growing up had no added sugar, but here we are!

They’re chocolatey and have an iciness that I love. They taste like if Yoo-hoo was a popsicle, which made the nostalgic part of my brain tingle. I took all of these home and eat one every night now.

They are so packed with fruit flavor and milky creaminess.
