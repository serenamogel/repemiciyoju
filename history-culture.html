She and Trump were part of New York City's social elite during the 1980s. The two split in 1990 and Ivana won a $20 million divorce settlement. She later published The Best Is Yet to Come: Coping With Divorce and Enjoying Life Again. In it, she advised divorcees to "take his wallet to the cleaners."</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ivana was born Ivana Marie Zelnícková on February 20, 1949, in Gottwaldov (now Zlín), Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Her athletic talents emerged at an early age. Ivana started skiing competitively at the age of six. At 12, she entered a national training program. During her teenage years, Ivana competed in tournaments throughout Europe. In 1967, she became a student at Charles University in Prague. Ivana continued to ski during college and stated she had been selected as an alternate for her country's ski team for the 1972 Olympics; however, her statement has been questioned for its legitimacy. Around this time, she married her first husband, Austrian skier Alfred Winklmayr. Their union only lasted a few years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eventually immigrating to Canada, Ivana spent some time working as a ski instructor before starting a modeling career in the 1970s. Her work eventually brought her to New York in 1976. During her time there, she met aspiring real estate mogul Trump.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage to Donald Trump</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a whirlwind courtship, Ivana married Trump in 1977. The couple had three children together, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/donald-trump-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Jr.</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ivanka-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ivanka class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ivanka</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/eric-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Eric class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eric</a>. She became a fixture in the elite New York social scene during the 1980s. Ivana also worked within her husband's company, serving as an interior design consultant on several of his high-profile projects, including the Trump Tower in New York City and the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. She held executive positions at the Plaza Hotel in New York and Trump's Castle Hotel and Casino for many years as well.</p><img alt="Ivana Trump, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, and Ivanka Trump as they sit at a table at the Mar-a-Lago in 1998" title="Ivana Trump, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, and Ivanka Trump as they sit at a table at the Mar-a-Lago in 1998" width=4858 height=3250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/trump-her-son-eric-trump-her-former-husband-businessman-donald-trump-and-her-daughter-ivanka-trump-as-they-sit-at-a-table-at-the-mar-a-lago-estate-palm-beach-florida-1998-photo-by-davidoff-studiosgett.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Davidoff Studios/Getty Images</span><p>Ivana and Donald Trump with two of their children, Eric and Ivanka</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While clearly she was an asset to his business, Ivana had a stormy relationship with her husband. Trump's high-profile political deal-making and enthusiastic self-promotion kept their marriage in the public eye. Ivana separated from her husband in 1990 amid rumors of his affair with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/marla-maples data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marla Maples" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marla Maples</a>. After lengthy divorce proceedings, Ivana won a $20 million divorce settlement. This figure was remarkable because Trump's real estate empire was tottering on the edge of bankruptcy at the time.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Recent Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her divorce, Ivana began to reinvent herself. She wrote two novels, For Love Alone and Free to Love, in the early 1990s. Ivana also shared her life experiences in the successful self-help book The Best Is Yet to Come: Coping With Divorce and Enjoying Life Again (1995). In her book, she advised women divorcees to "get yourself a great settlement—and before you do, take his wallet to the cleaners." That same year, Ivana married wealthy Italian businessman Riccardo Mazzucchelli. The couple only lasted two years before separating in 1997.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the late 1990s, Ivana created her own fashion company, Ivana Haute Couture, that manufactured clothes, fragrances and jewelry. She also started another company called Ivana Inc. to handle her public appearances and other media work, according to her official website. Trump had a cameo in the 1996 comedy The First Wives Club, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/goldie-hawn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Goldie Hawn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Goldie Hawn</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/diane-keaton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diane Keaton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Diane Keaton</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bette-midler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bette Midler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bette Midler</a>. In 2006, she had her own dating show, Ivana Young Man.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 2008, Ivana married Rossano Rubicondi. Ivana, 59, and Rubicondi, 36, dated for six years before they married in a lavish ceremony at Donald Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, estate. But this fourth trip down the aisle soon proved to be another short union. She announced their breakup that December. She blamed the split on the couple wanting to live in different cities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ivana returned to reality television in 2010 as a competitor on England's Celebrity Big Brother. The following year, she launched a new venture — a line of wines. She partnered with Legends Wines to sell her own collection of wines produced in California. Two years later, Ivana helped promote the work of artist Giovanni Perrone. She held an opening for him in New York City in May 2013.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ivana Trump died on July 14, 2022 after going into cardiac arrest.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=22 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Ivana Trump</li><li>Birth Year: 1949</li><li>Birth date: February 20, 1949</li><li>Birth City: Gottwaldov (now Zlín)</li><li>Birth Country: Czech Republic</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Ivana Trump was a former model who is best known as the first wife of President Donald Trump.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Pisces</li><li>Death Year: 2022</li><li>Death date: July 14, 2022</li><li>Death City: New York City</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=27 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Ivana Trump Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ivana-trump</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 14, 2022</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGifoqukpL%2B6ecKuo62topp8qsLAp5hmrKKqurE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-silverman.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Silverman Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
