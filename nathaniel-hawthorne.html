His short stories include "My Kinsman, Major Molineux" (1832), "Roger Malvin's Burial" (1832), "Young Goodman Brown" (1835) and the collection Twice-Told Tales. He is best known for his novels The Scarlet Letter (1850) and The House of the Seven Gables (1851). His use of allegory and symbolism make Hawthorne one of the most studied writers.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on July 4, 1804, in Salem Massachusetts, Hawthorne’s life was steeped in the Puritan legacy. An early ancestor, William Hathorne, first emigrated from England to America in 1630 and settled in Salem, Massachusetts, where he became a judge known for his harsh sentencing. William’s son, John Hathorne, was one of three judges during the Salem Witch Trials in the 1690s. Hawthorne later added a “w” to his name to distance himself from this side of the family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hawthorne was the only son of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Clark Hathorne (Manning). His father, a sea captain, died in 1808 of yellow fever while at sea. The family was left with meager financial support and moved in with Elizabeth’s wealthy brothers. A leg injury at an early age left Hawthrone immobile for several months during which time he developed a voracious appetite for reading and set his sights on becoming a writer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the aid of his wealthy uncles, young Hawthorne attended Bowdoin College from 1821 to 1825. There he met and befriended <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/henry-wadsworth-longfellow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry Wadsworth Longfellow" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> and future president <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-pierce data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin Pierce" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franklin Pierce</a>. By his own admission, he was a negligent student with little appetite for study.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Short Stories and Collections</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While attending college, Hawthorne missed his mother and two sisters terribly and upon graduation, returned home for a 12-year stay. During this time, he began to write with purpose and soon found his “voice” self-publishing several stories, among them "The Hollow of the Three Hills" and "An Old Woman’s Tale." By 1832, he had written "My Kinsman, Major Molineux" and "Roger Malvin’s Burial," two of his greatest tales and in 1837, Twice Told Tales. Though his writing brought him some notoriety, it didn’t provide a dependable income and for a time he worked for the Boston Custom House weighing and gaging salt and coal.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Budding Success and Marriage</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hawthorne ended his self-imposed seclusion at home about the same time he met Sophia Peabody, a painter, illustrator and transcendentalist. During their courtship, Hawthorne spent some time at the Brook Farm community where he got to know <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ralph-waldo-emerson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ralph Waldo Emerson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/henry-david-thoreau data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry David Thoreau" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Henry David Thoreau</a>. He didn’t find transcendentalism to his favor but living in the commune allowed him to save money for his impending marriage to Sophia. After a long courtship, partially prolonged by Sophia’s poor health, the couple was married on July 9, 1842. They quickly settled in Concord, Massachusetts, and rented Old Manse, owned by Emerson. In 1844, the first of their three children was born.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Scarlet Letter'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With mounting debt and a growing family, Hawthorne moved to Salem. A life-long Democrat, political connections helped him land a job as a surveyor in the Salem Custom House in 1846, providing his family some needed financial security. However, when Whig President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/zachary-taylor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Zachary Taylor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Zachary Taylor</a> was elected, Hawthorne lost his appointment due to political favoritism. The dismissal turned into a blessing giving him time to write his masterpiece, The Scarlet Letter, the story of two lovers who clashed with the Puritan moral law. The book was one of the first mass-produced publications in the United States and its wide distribution made Hawthorne famous.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Other Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Never feeling comfortable living in Salem, Hawthorne was determined to take his family out of the town’s Puritan trappings. They moved to Red House in Lenox, Massachusetts, where he formed a close friendship with Moby Dick author <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/herman-melville data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Herman Melville" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Herman Melville</a>. During this time, Hawthorne enjoyed his most productive period as a writer publishing The House of the Seven Gables, Blithedale Romance and Tanglewood Tales.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Years Abroad</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the 1852 election, Hawthorne wrote a campaign biography for his college friend Pierce. When Pierce was elected president, he appointed Hawthorne an American Consul to Britain as a reward. The Hawthorne’s stayed in England from 1853-1857. This period served as inspiration for Hawthorne’s novel Our Old Home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After serving as consul, Hawthorne took his family on an extended vacation to Italy and then back to England. In 1860, he finished his last novel The Marble Faun. That same year Hawthorne moved his family back to the United States and took permanent residence at The Wayside in Concord, Massachusetts.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Final Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After 1860, it was becoming apparent that Hawthorne was moving past his prime. Striving to rekindle his earlier productivity, he found little success. Drafts were mostly incoherent and left unfinished. Some even showed signs of psychic regression. His health began to fail and he seemed to age considerably, hair turning white and experiencing slowness of thought. For months, he refused to seek medical help and died in his sleep on May 19, 1864, in Plymouth, New Hampshire.</p><ul data-node-id=23 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Nathaniel Hawthorne</li><li>Birth Year: 1804</li><li>Birth date: July 4, 1804</li><li>Birth State: Massachusetts</li><li>Birth City: Salem</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Author Nathaniel Hawthorne is best known for his novels 'The Scarlet Letter' and 'The House of Seven Gables,' and also wrote many short stories.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Fiction and Poetry</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Death Year: 1864</li><li>Death date: May 19, 1864</li><li>Death State: New Hampshire</li><li>Death City: Plymouth</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=26><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Nathaniel Hawthorne Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/nathaniel-hawthorne</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: March 31, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=31 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Happiness is as a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but which if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.</li><li>No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYrqyYpL%2B0edaroK2doqh8r63ToZinoZWheqmt1q2fqKqemg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-sam-corchado-boyfriend-of-calysta-bevier-biography-net-worth-more.html><span>←</span><span>Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; more</span></a>
