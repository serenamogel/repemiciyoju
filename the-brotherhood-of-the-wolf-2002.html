It begins in 1794, at the time of the French Revolution, when its narrator (Jacques Paren), about to be carried away to the guillotine, puts the finishing touches on a journal revealing at last the true story of the Beast. Although a wolf was killed and presented to the court of the king, that was only a cover-up, he says, as we flash back to ...</p><p>Well, actually, the Beast attacks under the opening credits, even before the narrator appears. For the first hour or so we do not see it, but we hear fearsome growls, moans and roars, and see an unkempt but buxom peasant girl dragged to her doom. Enter Gregoire de Fronsac (<a href=#>Samuel Le Bihan</a>), an intellectual and naturalist, recently returned from exploring the St. Lawrence Seaway. He is accompanied by Mani, an Iroquois who speaks perfect French and perfect tree (he talks to them). Mani is played by <a href=#>Mark Dacascos</a>, a martial arts expert from Hawaii whose skills might seem out place in 18th century France, but no: Everyone in this movie fights in a style that would make <a href=#>Jackie Chan</a> proud.</p><p>Fronsac doubts the existence of a Beast. Science tells us to distrust fables, he explains. At dinner, he passes around a trout with fur, from Canada, which causes one of the guests to observe it must really be cold for the fish there, before he reveals it is a hoax. The Beast, alas, soon makes him a believer, but he sees a pattern: "The Beast is a weapon used by a man." But what man? Why? How? Charting the Beast's attacks on a map, he cleverly notices that all of the lines connecting them intersect at one point in rural Gevaudan. Fronsac and Mani go looking.</p><p>The local gentry include Jean-Francois (<a href=#>Vincent Cassel</a>), who has one arm, but has fashioned a rifle he can brace in the crook of his shoulder. It fires silver bullets (this is also a historical fact). His sister Marianne (<a href=#>Emilie Dequenne</a>) fancies Fronsac, which causes Jean-Francois to hate him, significantly. Also lurking about, usually with leaves in her hair, is the sultry Sylvia (<a href=#>Monica Bellucci</a>), who travels with men who might as well have "Lout" displayed on a sign around their necks, and likes to dance on table tops while they throw knives that barely miss her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkqe8tbTEq5%2Bop5RivKd506GcZq%2BfobNufo9paQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aliny-mendes-murder-ricardo-godinho.html><span>←</span><span>Aliny Mendes Murder: Where Is Ricardo Godinho Now?</span></a>
