He has 46 years on the clock. He has withheld a great deal of information about his parents and siblings. His father served in the United States Air Force, and the family frequently moved, including tours in Turkey and the Philippines. After graduating from North Central High School, Lake attended Eastern Washington University.</p><h2>Jimmy Lake Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Jimmy Lake</strong> is bald and has sparkling black eyes. Aside from that, there is no information on his height, weight, or other body measurements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jimmy-Lak-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>During his high school years, Jimmy participated in football, basketball, and baseball. He was a strong safety in collegiate football from 1995 to 1998. Lake was named team captain and earned honorable mention All-Big Sky honors after being named to the All-Big Sky Academic Team. Following graduation, the athlete worked as a graduate assistant before taking a job as the defensive backs coach at Eastern Washington.</p><p>Jimmy was hired as the new defensive back coach at the University of Washington in 2004. He then signed with Montana State before joining the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers the following season as an assistant defensive back coach. He was hired as the Detroit Lions’ defensive back coach after three seasons with the team. For two seasons in 2010, the coach returned to the Buccaneers as a defensive back coach. Lake was Boise State’s defensive backs coach in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>In 2014, he was hired as the University of Washington’s new defensive back coach. In 2016, he was promoted to Defensive Coordinator with the team. Jimmy was promoted to full-time defensive coordinator in 2018, and after Chris Peterson resigned in late 2019, Lake was named the team’s new head coach. He did not have a good start as a head coach, so he was hired in November 2020.</p><h2>Jimmy Lake Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Jimmy Lake’s net worth</strong> exceeds 5 million dollars as of October 2023. His fortune stems largely from his successful career in American football. In 2017, he was paid $650,000, and in 2018, his salary increased to $1.1 million, making him the Pac-12’s second-highest-paid assistant coach. Jimmy signed a three-year, $10 million contract with the University in 2019 and will begin receiving payments in the next two years.</p><h2>Jimmy Lake Wife, Marriage</h2><p>Jimmy’s wife is Michele, his longtime girlfriend. Despite the fact that they had been great friends for a very long time. They married in the late 1990s after finally opening up about their feelings. Because the couple had a private wedding ceremony and neither of them was famous at the time, much about their wedding remains a mystery.</p><p>Jimmy and Michele are extremely proud of their three children. Jimmy Jr., an Arizona State student, Faith, a Colorado State student starting this fall, and Bronson, a middle schooler, were born in early 2000.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihoqWdrnqtrcqeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-acaster-net-worth-63953.html><span>←</span><span>James Acaster Net Worth</span></a>
