She started as the lead singer of a psychedelic rock band called Crow and eventually made her way to New York City. In 1968, she joined the German production of the musical Hair in Munich, where she lived, acted, and sang for several years.</p><p>During her time there, she crossed paths with music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and they collaborated on influential disco hits such as “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love,” which propelled Summer to international success.</p><p>In 1976, she returned to the United States, and her string of hits continued with songs like “Last Dance,” “MacArthur Park,” “Heaven Knows,” “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “Dim All the Lights,” and “On the Radio.”</p><p>Throughout her career, Donna Summer achieved remarkable chart success. She had a total of 32 singles on the US Billboard Hot 100, including 14 top ten hits and four number one singles. Between 1976 and 1984, she had a top 40 hit every year, and from 1976 to 1982, she had 12 top ten hits, more than any other artist during that period.</p><p>She also topped the US Billboard 200 chart with three consecutive double albums and reached number one on the R&B Singles chart in the US. In the UK, she had a number one single as well. Although her presence on the Hot 100 declined in later years, she remained a force on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.</p><p>Tragically, <a href=# rel=noopener>Donna Summer</a> passed away on May 17, 2012, at the age of 63, due to lung cancer at her home in Naples, Florida. Her remarkable career included selling over 100 million records worldwide and winning five Grammy Awards.</p><p>She was hailed as the “undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom” and one of the world’s leading female singers. Summer’s work on the song “I Feel Love” was recognized as a pioneering contribution to electronic dance music. In 2013, she was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2016, Billboard ranked her as the sixth “Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists.”</p><p>During the mid-1980s, Donna Summer found herself at the center of a controversy surrounding alleged anti-gay remarks related to the emerging AIDS epidemic.</p><p>However, Summer vehemently denied making such comments and expressed her remorse in a letter addressed to the AIDS campaign group ACT UP in 1989, referring to it as a “terrible misunderstanding.” She also acknowledged that she had not responded to ACT UP earlier due to being shielded from negative press and hate mail. In an effort to seek forgiveness, she concluded her letter with Bible quotes from Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians.</p><p>In an interview with The Advocate magazine in 1989, Summer further addressed the issue, stating that she had been working closely with gay individuals, some of whom were her songwriting collaborators. She emphasized that personal preferences and choices regarding one’s body were entirely up to the individual.</p><p>Several years later, when New York magazine published an old story treating the rumors as factual just as she was preparing to release her album Mistaken Identity in 1991, Summer took legal action against the publication. The details of the lawsuit and its subsequent settlement were not publicly disclosed, as revealed in a Biography television program featuring Summer in 1995, where she actively participated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Donna Summer Net Worth: How Much is Donna Summer Worth?</h2><p>Donna Summer had an estimated net worth of not less than $70 million at the time of her death in 2012.
