And while there’s no confirmation from the studio on that just yet, bringing Jonah Hill on board to play the Penguin does seem a little too obvious and it could be more interesting to see him as Edward Nygma instead.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>If you’re having trouble picturing him as the Riddler, though, we’ve got some new artwork today which just may help, and it can be seen in the gallery down below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/70505320_106084907352272_5887230937610356117_n.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Brought to us by digital artist UltraRaw26, this is definitely a bit of a different design than we’re used to seeing from previous portrayals of the Riddler. That being said, with The Batman&nbsp;set to be a more grounded, gritty take on the DC property, it could definitely work.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>In any case, while the villain was played by Jim Carrey at the height of his scenery-chewing powers back in 1995’s Batman Forever, it’s unlikely that Hill’s take on the character would follow a similar path. And though he’s mostly known for his comedic chops, the actor’s also shown that he can nail more dramatic parts, too, so he’d certainly be a good fit.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=false>With any luck, we’ll get some confirmation on who he’s playing sooner rather than later, but until then, know that&nbsp;<strong>The Batman&nbsp;</strong>swoops into theaters on June 25th, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaimkZ16qbXLpWSroZSZuaa%2BjJuYraWRo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eden-choi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-552053-html.html><span>←</span><span>Eden Choi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
