Bet it,” to which the “Ride Along” star replied, “If my son cry, I want the money. We in a pandemic so I need you to send it asap.” O’Neal, clearly sure of his chances, told his friend, “I’ll send it.”</p><p>When little Kenzo came over to his dad, he was initially happy and interactive, saying “Hi!” to his “Uncle Shaq.” It didn’t take long before his smiles turned to a grimace and then a cry, however, once Hart began asking him questions like “Is that scary? Are you scared?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-9.02.54-PM-600x387.png><p>The “Night School” star claims that Shaq still hasn’t made good on the bet he claims he won. “@shaq&nbsp;made my son cry and never paid me. This is unacceptable 😂😂😂😂😂,” he jokingly captioned his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p><p>Fans cracked up at the sight of the two goofballs having fun with each other, and folks were divided over who won the bet, with some even accusing Kevin of cheating by pinching his baby boy.</p><p>“You damn well know you pinched that baby 😂😂😂😂”</p><p>“The gagging sent me 🤣🤣🤣”</p><p>“He scared him 😂😂”</p><p>“@kevinhart4real&nbsp;you were leading him and poking him.😂😂😂 He smiled at&nbsp;@shaq&nbsp;at first!”</p><p>“He was gagging, I have no words🤣🤣🤣”</p><p>Whether Kevin will ever get his money is as much of a mystery as which star actually won the bet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49qZmlvX52ybr%2FCmqmenF2dtq55xZqlrGWTp66kt4yup2anppq%2FbsLInZyoZZ%2Bbeqyx1aKlZqCRp8FursStq6Kml2LAqa3QZmhpaGBiwamt02aqqKZdoLKvxs5mrqitnJl6o7GMmp2rmZmZerCyjKGgpmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-wilde-wedding-2017.html><span>←</span><span>The Wilde Wedding movie review (2017)</span></a>
