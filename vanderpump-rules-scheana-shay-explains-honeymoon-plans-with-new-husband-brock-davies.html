During Season 9 of the Bravo show, Brock confided in co-stars Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix that he had grand plans for proposing to Scheana.</p><p>After his initial plans for a secret proposal and wedding fell through, Brock ultimately proposed simply on a balcony decorated with balloons. He professed his love to Scheana and asked for her hand, which she enthusiastically accepted.</p><p>The couple, who welcomed their daughter Summer Moon in April 2021, spent several months planning out their special day. And after much deliberation, the new parents <a href=#>settled on a Mexican vacation wedding in August</a>.</p><p>Following pre-wedding celebrations, including a <a href=#>surprise bridal party hosted at Lisa Vanderpump’s Villa Rosa</a>, the couple finally said “I do” and began their new chapter as husband and wife.</p><p>And while they’re ready to continue building a life together, Scheana recently shared they have no immediate plans to head on a honeymoon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vanderpump-rules-star-scheana-shay-has-no-plans-for-a-honeymoon-any-time-soon>Vanderpump Rules star Scheana Shay has no plans for a honeymoon any time soon</h2><p>During a recent episode of her Scheananigans podcast, Scheana delved into details about the pair’s plans for a honeymoon following their wedding.</p><p>According to Scheana, they will celebrate their nuptials with a honeymoon eventually, just not quite yet.</p><p>“Eventually, not right away,” <a href=#>Scheana shared</a>. “Not right after like I did the first time.”</p><p>Scheana famously wed ex-husband Michael Shay in 2014, and the wedding was filmed for Season 3 of Vanderpump Rules. Her marriage to Michael Shay lasted three years before they filed for divorce.</p><p>Scheana added that her mindset has changed since her first wedding, and she no longer believes a honeymoon must take place right after the ceremony.</p><p>“[I used to believe] you have to go on the honeymoon two days after the wedding,” she said before acknowledging just how much her life has changed since then.</p><p>“[We’ve] got a baby,” she noted. “We got s**t going on!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In addition to taking care of their daughter and filming for Vanderpump Rules Season 10, Scheana also clarified there are other trips that will take priority.</p><p>“There’s other trips we want to take first—a family trip back to Australia, some other little ones here—so no rush on the honeymoon, but we’ll definitely take a vacay eventually,” Scheana concluded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brock-surprised-scheana-with-trip-plans-shortly-after-their-wedding>Brock surprised Scheana with trip plans shortly after their wedding</h2><p>Although Scheana indicated there were no plans in place for the newlyweds to head on a honeymoon right away, Brock seemingly had something else up his sleeve.</p><p>While speaking to People, Brock surprised Scheana by teasing that he had already planned a trip for them without her knowing.</p><p>“It’s booked,” he shared.</p><p>Without divulging details for the excursion, Brock hinted to his new bride, “Think crystal blue waters.”</p><p>As of this writing, it’s unknown if Brock and Scheana’s wedding was captured by Bravo cameras and if it will be featured in the show’s upcoming season.</p><p>Vanderpump Rules is currently on hiatus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6aWu6Wx0amspqhdp8KtsdJmqpyglZa7onnSoZiyZZWtva2tyKeqZqCfo7K6uc6opWaonJa7tHnWoquhZZ6axG601KyZmqaUYq%2Bzu8KkZJ2Zpp6ytHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./skyla-novea-net-worth-321248.html><span>←</span><span>Skyla Novea Net Worth</span></a>
