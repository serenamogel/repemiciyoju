Surprisingly, the writer divulged that Travis begged him to not “do him like that” during their two-hour conversation for&nbsp;<i>Complex</i>’s December 2015/January 2016 issue.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>At the time, the “Highest in the Room” artist called the Fenty founder his “muse.” He also gushed over how “inspiring” and “creative” RiRi is.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Apparently, what [<i>Complex</i>&nbsp;editor Joe] LaPuma, our boy Joe The Puma, told me was that it hurt&nbsp;<i>Complex</i>’s relationship with Travis. This was in 2015/16 I wrote this. But, apparently, for the next couple of years, he would complain about that,” added the entertainment writer.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The “Work” artist met Travis at the Opening Ceremony show during New York Fashion Week in 2013. Two years later, they collaborated on her song “Bitch Better Have My Money” and dating rumors followed shortly after that.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In September of that year, they were seen getting cozy at a handful of events. It’s unclear when they exactly fizzled out, but the “Antidote” artist joined Rihanna’s “The Anti World Tour” in March 2016.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_editorial_10373111ao.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Of course, Travis went on to date&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>&nbsp;</b>in 2017 after she <a href=#>broke things off</a> with her longtime beau&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Tyga</b></a>.
