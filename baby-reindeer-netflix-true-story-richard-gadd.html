But when a series decides to blend fact and fiction, it’s natural for viewers to question the unwritten rules of true-crime dramatizations. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g30853622/best-movies-on-netflix/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Netflix class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Netflix</a>’s latest effort in the harrowing genre, Baby Reindeer, is currently dealing with the consequences of toeing that line.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show stars British comedian Richard Gadd, who wrote an autobiographical one-man show about his experience with a violent stalker that ran in London’s West End. Baby Reindeer seeks to tell that story over the course of a scripted seven-episode series, with actors portraying versions of real people in Gadd’s life—including his alleged stalker.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gadd plays Donny Dunn, a fictionalized version of himself, and dramatizes a four-year span in Gadd’s twenties when he was harassed, sexually assaulted, and stalked by a woman (portrayed by actor Jessica Gunning) he met at the pub where he worked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since the show’s debut in mid-April, Baby Reindeer has turned into a word-of-mouth success for Netflix. The series experienced an unusual growth in viewership over its first three weeks, rising to the top of the streamer’s most-watched list in both the U.S. and the UK. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2024/04/baby-reindeer-viewership-tops-netflix-1235900123/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Deadline</a>, Baby Reindeer’s audience shot from around 2.6 million in its first week to 22 million two weeks later. Even horror writer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/stephen-king data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen King" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Stephen King</a> chimed in on the phenomenon on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/stephenking/status/1783651694783393992?s=46" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=X class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">X</a>, exclaiming, “BABY REINDEER: Holy s—.”<br></p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Also Streaming on Netflix</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Fans began speculating the alleged stalker's identity</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With increased interest in Gadd’s autobiographical story, the need to protect Baby Reindeer’s real-life counterparts only grew. On social media, Gadd and Gunning urged fans to stop searching for the real stalker—renamed Martha Scott on the series to hide her identity. “People I love, have worked with, and admire… are unfairly getting caught up in speculation,” Gadd <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/baby-reindeer-real-people-speculation-controversy-rcna148991 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=wrote class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">wrote</a> to fans in an Instagram story. “Please don’t speculate on who any of the real-life people could be. That’s not the point of our show.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Previously, Gadd told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/baby-reindeer-richard-gadd-real-stalker-martha-1235976307/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Variety</a> that the events of the series are “all emotionally 100 percent true.” The British comedian also stressed that “you can’t do the exact truth, for both legal and artistic reasons.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There’s certain protections; you can’t just copy somebody else’s life and name and put it onto television. And obviously, we were very aware that some characters in it are vulnerable people, so you don’t want to make their lives more difficult. So you have to change things to protect yourself and protect other people,” he explained.</p><img alt="baby reindeer netflix" title="baby reindeer netflix" width=6000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/br-101-unit-00320-rt-jpg-br-101-unit-00320-rt-min-66325a4e12bfb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Ed Miller</span><span class="css-1tkmd1w e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Comedian Richard Gadd stars as Donny, a fictionalized version of himself, in Baby Reindeer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The problem? Some of those protections are not so airtight. Sean Foley, a Tony-nominated actor who resembles a character on the show, found himself inexplicably tied to accusations and online abuse from fans. It continued even after Gadd asked fans to stop harassing Foley and cease speculation about the people behind the series. “Police have been informed and are investigating all defamatory abusive and threatening posts against me,” Foley wrote on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/SeanFoleyJ/status/1782655837489492126 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=X class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">X</a>, reposting Gadd’s message to fans.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">A woman claims she is the real subject</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an exclusive interview with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13349331/netflix-baby-reindeer-defamatory-posts-sean-foley-director-police.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daily Mail" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Daily Mail</a>, Gadd’s self-alleged real-life stalker weighed in on the controversy, though the publication declined to use her real name. “He’s using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now,” the woman claimed. “I’m the victim. He’s written a bloody show about me.” She also threatened legal action against Gadd. The Baby Reindeer creator has yet to comment on his alleged stalker speaking to the press about the series, but Gadd maintains that it went to great lengths to protect her identity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wanted to show the nuances of the human condition, really,” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lio_UWu3BOI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="This Morning" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">This Morning</a> right after the series hit Netflix. “I wanted to show that people are a mixture of good and bad, and I think stalker stories usually tend to be one person is good, one person is bad. And I wanted to kind of get away from that.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/dfe01d1f-bbbd-4b7a-a746-f913e676f7e3_1646663577.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Josh Rosenberg" title="Headshot of Josh Rosenberg" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an assistant editor at Esquire, Rosenberg covers film, TV, sports, anime, music, and video games.
