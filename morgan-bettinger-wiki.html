She became embroiled in a dispute as a senior in 2020. Morgan was driving home from work one day in July 2020 when she noticed a blockage caused by a public works vehicle amid a gathering of Black Lives Matter demonstrators. She said to the truck driver, “It’s a good thing you’re here; otherwise, they could be made into speed bumps.” Protesters began following her, yelling and recording her as she returned to her car. Morgan Bettinger, a fellow UVA student, accused Morgan on Twitter of driving through police barricades and making threats. This tweet quickly went viral, prompting calls for Morgan’s dismissal.</p><p>Morgan testified in a student misconduct prosecution, admitting to making a similar remark to the truck driver but denying that he meant it as a threat. The institution subsequently exonerated her of any misconduct, but the episode left an indelible mark on her. This charge triggered a chain of events that had a significant impact on Bettinger’s life. Bettinger faced disciplinary proceedings as a result of the claims brought against her, and Bryant lobbied for her expulsion from school. However, Bryant then conceded that she may not have heard the reported words correctly, casting doubt on the veracity of her charges.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Morgan Bettinger Wiki, Biography, Age, Net WortActivismsim, Education, Parents, Ethnicity, Height">Morgan Bettinger Wiki, Biography, Age, Net WortActivismsim, Education, Parents, Ethnicity, Height</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Who is Morgan Bettinger">Who is Morgan Bettinger</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Morgan Bettinger Age, Family, Early Life, Education, Biography">Morgan Bettinger Age, Family, Early Life, Education, Biography</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title=Career>Career</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Morgan Bettinger Boyfriend">Morgan Bettinger Boyfriend</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="Morgan Bettinger Height, Weight">Morgan Bettinger Height, Weight</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title="Net Worth">Net Worth</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Morgan_Bettinger_Wiki_Biography_Age_Net_WortActivismsim_Education_Parents_Ethnicity_Height></span><strong>Morgan Bettinger Wiki, Biography, Age, Net WortActivismsim, Education, Parents, Ethnicity, Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table width=736><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Morgan Bettinger</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1999</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend Name</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>24&nbsp;Years Old</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5.6 Feet</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>59 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blond</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Warrenton, Virginia, America</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td>Father’s Name</td><td>Wayne Bettinger</td></tr><tr><td>Mother’s Name</td><td>Cary Bettinger</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100K</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Morgan_Bettinger></span><strong>Who is Morgan Bettinger</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Morgan Bettinger is a former University of Virginia (UVA) student who was unjustly accused in 2020 of making racist and violent comments to a gathering of Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Charlottesville.

She was raised by her mother, Cary Bettinger, and father, Wayne Bettinger. Her mother, Cary, worked as a nurse at the University of Virginia’s Charlottesville hospital for 15 years, and her father, Wayne, was a Charlottesville police officer for nearly two decades. Morgan respected her father’s profession in law enforcement and hoped to one day attend the University of Virginia and practice law in Charlottesville. Bettinger graduated from Albemarle High School in Charlottesville in 2017. She subsequently enrolled in the University of Virginia, where she majored in psychology with a minor in sociology. When the confrontation with the demonstrators happened in July 2020, she was a rising senior at UVA.

She also worked as a research assistant at the University of Virginia’s Department of Psychology and as a teaching assistant at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education and Human Development. Her scholastic and personal successes, however, were overshadowed by a contentious episode in the summer of 2020, when she was accused by a popular student activist of making violent threats to a throng of Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Charlottesville.</p><p>Morgan Bettinger, an activist, alleged Bettinger drove over police barriers and told demonstrators they would make “good speed bumps.” Bryant’s claims went viral on social media and were covered by local news sources. Bettinger faced internet hostility, death threats, and requests to expel her from UVA. Bettinger rejected the claims, claiming she just made a passing comment to a dump truck driver who was obstructing the road. She claimed she told the driver, “It’s a good thing you’re here because otherwise these people would have been speed bumps.” She stated that her remark was meant as a pleasant jest and that she had no intention of harming or offending anyone.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Morgan_Bettinger_Boyfriend></span><strong>Morgan Bettinger </strong><strong>Boyfriend</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Morgan is now unmarried and unattached.
