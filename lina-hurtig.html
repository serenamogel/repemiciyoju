That’s a true role model for me and if I am a role model, that’s how I want us to be looked at.”</p><p>Despite thinking they are no role model material, we can be sure that many youths, especially players, look them up as their role models.</p><h2>Professional Life</h2><h3>Summary Stats</h3><table><tbody><tr><td width=108><strong>2021-2022</strong></td><td width=48><strong>MP</strong></td><td width=78><strong>Min</strong></td><td width=78><strong>Gls</strong></td><td width=78><strong>Ast</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=108><strong>Serie A</strong></td><td width=48>9</td><td width=78>532</td><td width=78>1</td><td width=78>3</td></tr><tr><td width=108><strong>Champions Lg</strong></td><td width=48>4</td><td width=78>283</td><td width=78>1</td><td width=78>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>How old is Lina Hurtig?
