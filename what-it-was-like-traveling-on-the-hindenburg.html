In the resulting chaos, Doehner, his brother, and his mother all managed to escape, but Doehner's father and sister both died in the fire. Doehner would spend three months in a New York City hospital recovering from the burns he received to his face, legs, and hands, which required skin grafts.</p><p>Today, scientists and researchers continue to debate what ultimately caused the Hindenburg to burst into flames and crash (via <a href=#>Smithsonian Magazine</a>). Most scientists agree that highly flammable hydrogen, mixing with oxygen, provided the perfect "gasoline" for the fire. But they've come to slightly different conclusions about what caused the spark that devoured the dirigible in 34 seconds. One of the most outspoken researchers is Addison Bain, a NASA rocket fuel expert. According to <a href=#>Florida Today</a>, Bain hypothesizes the zeppelin's butyl-based paint coating may have failed to dissipate the buildup of electrical charges outside of the airship. The result?&nbsp;A monster-sized accumulation of deadly static electricity that ignited the cover and then the hydrogen inside.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlWprcnBfrLWiwIyiq2avkah6rbXKnmStqpGrsq21zaBkqKZdqbWmeceipZ2dnpfCs7OO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamea-harris-death-darius-miles-michael-davis.html><span>←</span><span>Shot To Death By Darius And Michael</span></a>
