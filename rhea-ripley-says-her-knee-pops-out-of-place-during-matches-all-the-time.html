As SmackDown Women’s Champion, she is still going strong. That being said, her body has seen a lot of damage as well.</p><p>Some fans might have noticed that Rhea Ripley has given special attention to her knee during big matches. That isn’t just a sell-job, because The Nightmare apparently has frequent issues with her knee popping out of place.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Greg & The Morning Buzz</a>, a host mentioned Rhea Rhea’s knee popping at WrestleMania 39 against Charlotte Flair. She then revealed that this happens all the time.</p><p>“No, my knee didn’t pop out. What happened to me? Something happened. I can’t remember what it was. It might have been my knee. My knee always pops out, it’s just a reoccurring thing for me. I can never remember which matches it actually does it in.”</p><p>Rhea Ripley doesn’t wrestle very often on television, but she makes it count when she does. The Nightmare also stays in peak condition at all times. That obviously helps her out, but it might not do wonders for her knee.</p><p>Hopefully, Rhea Ripley’s knee issues don’t multiply, because that could hamper her momentum in WWE. At this point, Rhea Ripley is showing no signs of slowing down at all.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with Rhea Ripley in WWE?
