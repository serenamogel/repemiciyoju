We’re expecting an After the Final Rose special, too.</p><p>If the show continues to follow The Bachelor format, we should get a Women Tell All episode, though we can’t imagine there’s much dirt to dish on Gerry.</p><p>There’s plenty to dish about <a href=#>Faith Martin</a>, though, as she moves forward toward the final rose.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-faith-martin-on-the-golden-bachelor>Here’s what you need to know about Faith Martin on The Golden Bachelor</h2><p>Faith Martin is 61, making her the youngest of Gerry’s final three women. She is multi-talented, working as a teacher, a musician, and a radio host. She has music listed on <a href=#>Spotify </a>and Apple Music that The Golden Bachelor viewers can check out,</p><p>She loves her family and often shares photos of her children and grandchildren on Instagram. She also likes to show off her dogs and her horse.</p><p>Faith was born and raised in Santa Cruz, California, but lived in Utah before settling in Benton City, Washington.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Faith made a significant impression on Gerry when she pulled up on a motorcycle on premiere night. Most of the women showed up in a limo to meet The Golden Bachelor lead.</p><p>In fact, Faith made such a great impression that she got the First Impression Rose and knew she was safe ahead of the first rose ceremony.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-faith-enjoyed-a-luxurious-one-on-one-date-with-gerry>Faith enjoyed a luxurious one-on-one date with Gerry</h2><p>It seems that Kathy should have been jealous of Faith instead of Theresa because she’s the one who got the “priceless” luxury one-on-one date with Gerry that started with a helicopter ride and ended with a dip in a jacuzzi while sailing on a yacht.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>It was on that one-on-one date that <a href=#>Faith secured just one of only three roses</a> that would guarantee her spot at the Hometown Dates.</p><p>While Gerry did take the other ladies on a group date, he didn’t hand out a rose there, instead making them wait until the rose ceremony so he could have some extra time to think about it.</p><p>The Golden Bachelor airs on Thursdays at 8/7c on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5aWtrW0jKaYq6yZo3qwuoytn55ll6S5pbHNZpmam5iaubC%2BjLCfmqxdqbxut82ormaZkqTCtXnToZxmoJmctW6%2FwqGmqKRdqbKir8eeqWaglZaxprCMraZmoJ%2BisrW71qeqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-brandon-fugal-everything-to-know-about-the-owner-of-skinwalker-ranch.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Brandon Fugal?
