Let’s begin with a poem:
Giant Deborah, hear our call.
You are big and we are small.
We hunger for your snacky treats.
Your pie is all we want to eat."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

During this Gut Check taste test back in June 2022, Rhett & Link tried 22 Little Debbie snacks to see which had the most BDE (big Deborah energy). Here were the top four.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

This love of all things peanut and buttery may skew the results a little for those of you non-peanut-enjoying types, but generally speaking Rhett & Link (or the peanut butter boys, as they call themselves) have a pretty good idea of which peanut butter-flavored foods shine and which are just okay. These PB creme pies were apparently not only more phenomenal than the original oatmeal creme pies but they were also larger and fluffier. They reminded Link of a soft Nutter Butter—a dream come true for him, a soft cookie and a peanut butter type of guy. This selection, however, was almost a toss-up with the second place item.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Strawberry Shortcake Rolls</a>&nbsp;</strong><p>These swirly cakes surprised Rhett & Link in the best possible way. Link immediately said they looked ugly out of the package and Rhett said they looked beautiful. The conclusion? Art is subjective and you are totally entitled to your opinion. In terms of flavor, though,&nbsp; Link thought these seemed like a strawberry cheesecake on vanilla cake situation and he was HERE for it. In the end, they both thought the taste of these rolls was not only phenomenal but also different from any of the other flavors they tasted that day.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oatmeal Creme Pies</a>&nbsp;</strong><p>We all knew this was coming—the original creme pies from Little Debbie’s are damn near perfect, so it makes sense they made it into the top three. These super-sweet spiced cakes with marshmallow-y vanilla crème filling are unparalleled in the snacking world. Rhett & Link noted that Debbie deserves mad props for these bad boys, given that they have been around and managed to stay relevant since Rhett & Link were kids.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chocolate Cupcakes&nbsp;</a></strong><p>Rhett & Link liked these okay, but they didn’t like them as much as Hostess Cupcakes, and they aren’t as unique or fun as some of the other treats on this list. Plus, according to Rhett, the chocolate had a weird, chemical-y flavor. Link didn’t mind it, but it bothered Rhett enough to knock the Fudge Rounds out of the running (though Link really liked them), along with all chocolate items besides the cupcakes, which it seems were just okay.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="We Tried EVERY Little Debbie Snack" title='Play video "We Tried EVERY Little Debbie Snack"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG3BCcVor5Y&t=969s</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqYmsG1ecuipaRll6K6brjIraulnV2ZsqOuyJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-cain-net-worth-243303.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Cain Net Worth 2024</span></a>
