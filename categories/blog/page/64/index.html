Once at her apartment building, she runs into Veronique, a neighbor. Played by Emily Ratajkowski, who speaks in an accent that’s as outlandish as it is geographically unidentifiable, the character is plainly an extrovert. She thanks Sofia for agreeing to play at “my father’s benefit,” and when asked by Sofia about the perfume she’s wearing tells her it’s her little secret.
At this point the movie shifts gears. Sofia’s night of unusual dreams gives way to a following day conveyed in a speedy, disconcerting montage, during which Sofia trips on the stairs of her building, brought low by a short scarf of Veronique’s that’s fallen off the woman.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mafia Mamma movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</h2><time>Mar 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../mafia-mamma-movie-review-2023.html></a>
After the success of Hardwicke and Collette’s last collaboration, the wonderfully layered female friendship in 2015’s dramedy “Miss You Already,” a re-teaming was definitely welcomed. However, “Mafia Mamma” is a premise in search of fleshed-out characters. The Italian and clueless American stereotypes wouldn’t be so terrible if the film succeeded in being a satire, or at least the jokes were ever funny. Instead, "Mafia Mamma" lives in the uncanny valley between incompetent and unwatchable.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hugo Almonte</h2><time>Mar 1, 2024</time>

Fifteen years of starring in Supernatural just wasn’t enough for Jensen Ackles, who immediately jumped on the opportunity to executive produce its prequel, The Winchesters. The CW, however, appears to be done with the horror franchise and wasted little time taking a page from Netflix’s book, canceling the show after only one season.

Who Was Phyllis Schlafly?Conservative firebrand Phyllis Schlafly has been credited with swaying public opinion and preventing the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution.

Directed by Christophe Gans, "The Brotherhood of the Wolf" is couched in historical terms. It begins in 1794, at the time of the French Revolution, when its narrator (Jacques Paren), about to be carried away to the guillotine, puts the finishing touches on a journal revealing at last the true story of the Beast. Although a wolf was killed and presented to the court of the king, that was only a cover-up, he says, as we flash back to .</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Watch: B.J.

It’s departures across the board for upcoming crime comedy flick Vengeance, with directorial debutant B.J. Novak donning the director’s chair alongside his actor’s shoes, and production company Blumhouse leaning into their comedic side more than we’re used to seeing. Both of these ventures certainly seem to check out as far as the trailer goes.
