Julia Fox is having quite a busy fashion month. She's stepped out in New York and Milan, and now Paris, in a slew of outfits that have ranged from eccentric (a naked dress with a tiny bellybutton cutout) to straight-up shocking (carrying a dummy in a body bag as a purse). But her latest look, while still awe-inducing to the everyday person, is tame in comparison.&nbsp;

The colonel's ideas are not Politically Correct. On the other hand, he is not a sexist animal, either; he has an old-fashioned regard for women, mixed with yearning and fascination, and the respect of a gentleman who has lived his life in the military and never known a woman very well. He almost believes he can inhale a woman's scent and tell you all about her - what color her hair is, or her eyes, and whether she has a merry light in her eyes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Annabelle: Creation movie review (2017)</h2><time>Sep 28, 2024</time>

Just as that box office hit centered on a group of sisters caught in a nightmare, ‚ÄúAnnabelle: Creation‚Äù is essentially a haunted house flick with another collection of young girls faced with things that go bump in the night.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>John Abraham Net Worth</h2><time>Sep 28, 2024</time>
