Driscoll, a vibrant soul who graced this world with her warmth, kindness, and infectious spirit. Born on November 27, 1989, in Melrose, Massachusetts, to Ellen and John A. Driscoll, Kayla’s journey on this earth concluded tragically on December 13, 2023, in an accident on Interstate 93.</p><p>A proud graduate of Somerville High School in 2007, Kayla’s passion for helping others led her to pursue Muscular Therapy at the Cortiva Institute for Muscular Therapy in Watertown, MA, where she graduated in May 2015. As a Massage Therapist, she specialized in working with clients who had experienced trauma, creating safe and therapeutic spaces for healing.</p><p>Kayla’s presence was a beacon of joy. Her infectious smile could light up the darkest room, and her laughter, contagious and uplifting, echoed the joy she brought to those around her. A creative soul, Kayla excelled at do-it-yourself projects, infusing beauty and festivity into everything she touched.</p><p>Her love extended to family, and she was a beloved Titia to her niece Alana and Auntie Kayla to Pierce and Lilia. Children were drawn to her warm and nurturing personality, cherishing the moments filled with tickles, hugs, and fun gifts. Kayla was not only kind, protective, and loyal but also the first person to offer a helping hand to those she loved.</p><p>She leaves behind a legacy of love and memories cherished by her parents, Ellen and John A. Driscoll, her brother John J. Driscoll and his wife Amanda Driscoll, niece Alana, as well as numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. Predeceased by her grandparents Dorothy and Paul O’Neil, and Albert and Barbara Driscoll, Kayla’s impact on the lives she touched will forever resonate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKORrrmiecOroKybn6G5brvBoquumaKueqJ5y6KdnmWcnsOmsIywoK2gXaWutL%2FIqKVmmZ6ZerHB0ammrJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./war-machine-2017.html><span>←</span><span>War Machine movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</span></a>
