UK teenager Ellie Gould had no idea that when she opened the door for her ex-boyfriend, he would strangle and stab her to death.
The 17-year-old was murdered just one day after she broke up with Thomas Griffiths, also 17, to focus on her school exams.
The shocking murder in May 2019 – which features in the new series of Murder At My Door in the UK – left Gould's family devastated."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
