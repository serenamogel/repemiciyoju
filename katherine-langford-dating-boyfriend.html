For her performance, she even received a Golden Globe Award nomination.</p><p>Following that, she played in several well-acclaimed movies and TV shows such as Love, Simon (2018), Knives Out (2019), <a href=#>Cursed</a> (2020), Spontaneous (2020), and Savage River (2022).</p><p>Though her time in the entertainment industry has been short, she has managed to astonish audiences and win the hearts of millions worldwide. And fans are now eager to know if there is a special one who has managed to win her heart. Here is a detailed look at her love life!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Katherine Langford dating a boyfriend?</h2><p>Before answering if the actress has a boyfriend or not, let’s clear up another fan query, “Is Katherine Langford married to a husband?” and “Katherine Langford husband name.” The answer to both these questions is, “No, Katherine Langford isn’t married to a husband.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As of this writing, there have been no reports of Langford sharing the wedding vows with a possible husband. And since she is unmarried, the fan query of “Katherine Langford husband name” goes out to be void.</p><p>Now, let’s circle back to her dating life. Does she have a partner at the moment? The answer to this question is much like the answer above. And it’s because Langford has always been very tight-lipped when it comes to her personal life.</p><p>She hasn’t been seen hanging out alongside a handsome hunk by the paparazzi. Neither has she hinted at anything via her social media handles. She only shares pictures and clips of herself and her profession.</p><p>Considering all the things stated above, Langford’s present relationship status seems to be single. It seems she is very content with achieving a successful acting career and has kept her full focus on that only.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Katherine-Langford-boyfriend.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Katherine Langford during an event for Prada in Milan, Italy (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>On the other hand, if she isn’t single and has a partner, she has been very successful in hiding her supposed boyfriend from the outside world. Nonetheless, it could not be said what the exact situation is unless the actress herself says anything.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Katherine Langford’s rumored relationships</h2><p>After 13 Reasons Why aired globally, rumors that Langford was dating her co-star <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/dylan-minnette/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Minnette</a> began to spread.</p><p>In the show, Minnette’s character, Clay Jensen, had a crush on Langford’s character, Hannah Baker. Their on-screen chemistry was loved by many, and it was the main reason behind people thinking that the two stars were in a relationship.</p><p>So, were Langford and Minnette dating each other? To give a straightforward answer — No. Langford and Minnette are/were not in a relationship, and the speculations are false.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Katherine-Langford-Milan-Italy.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><span style=background-color:transparent class="has-inline-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">Katherine Langford as Hannah Baker and Dylan Minnette as Clay Jensen in ’13 Reasons Why.’ (Photo: Beth Dubber/Netflix)</span></p><p>Neither of them confirmed the rumors, as nothing was going on between them. Although they weren’t dating, they had a good friendship, of which the actress also spoke during one of her interviews.</p><p>She said, “He’s fantastic. Dylan Minnette is so generous and kind and courteous and he’s pretty much Clay. Clay is sweet and lovely and just ever-giving to Hannah. Every time I got on set — playing Hannah Baker — it’s kind of like going through six months of bullying.”</p><p>“But every single scene I had with Dylan, it would put a smile on my face. He would always be there to kind of lighten the day,” the 5 feet 5½ inches tall actress further added. Besides this one speculation, Langford’s love life has been a mystery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dylan Minnette was in a relationship during dating rumors with Katherine Langford</h2><p>When Langford was rumored to be dating her co-star Minnette, the latter was already jumping from one relationship to another. He was <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/relationship/dylan-minnette-girlfriend-lydia-night/ rel="noreferrer noopener">dating</a> his co-star Kerris Dorsey after meeting while filming the 2014 movie Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Their relationship was very public, as they often attended red-carpet events, movie premieres, and so on. But, it was quite the opposite at the end of their relationship, as they parted ways privately in late 2017 or early 2018.</p><p>After that, he was in a romantic relationship with his girlfriend, Lydia Night. Minnette and Night first sparked romance rumors in early October 2018 after being caught having a PDA moment at Knott’s Scary Farm.</p><p>An eye-witness told E! News, “The two held hands and at one point Dylan was rubbing her back. They exchanged a couple of kisses outside one of the mazes.”</p><p>And a couple of days later, on the occasion of Night’s birthday, October 13, 2018, Minnette took to his Instagram handle and wished her with a simple caption of “happy bday @lydianight :).”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Katherine-Langford-and-Dylan-Minnette-in-13-Reasons-Why.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Dylan Minnette with his ex-girlfriend Lydia Night (Photo: Twitter)</p><p>Afterward, they were seen multiple times at different events and public places, making it obvious they were romantically involved. As time passed, their romance became more obvious as they often featured each other on their respective social media handles.</p><p>For instance, on Minnette’s 25th birthday on December 29, 2021, the musician shared multiple adorable pictures of them together, including some photos where they were seen kissing.</p><p>Likewise, she wrote a heartfelt caption that read, “happy birthday to the most incredible, beautiful, and freakin perfect partner in crime… I feel so honored to get to spend another birthday by your side kissing ur face off. i love you forever dyl &lt;3.”</p><p>Sadly, the duo of Minnette and Night wasn’t meant to last forever, as the latter <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/relationship/lydia-night-break-up-boyfriend/ rel="noreferrer noopener">announced her break up</a> with Minnette in December 2022. The rumors of their split had been going on for a while, and Night confirmed it via an Instagram story.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Since his split from Night, Minnette has found himself <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/exclusive/dylan-minnette-girlfriend-isabella-elei/ rel="noreferrer noopener">another girlfriend</a>, Isabella Elei. Elei is a Canadian-American model who gained fame after being featured on the cover of Purple Magazine’s 30-year issue in 2022.</p><p>As for their relationship, the actor went Instagram official with his new/current partner on June 11, 2023, by sharing a black and white photo of them together at a photo booth. As of now, there aren’t many details available about the new couple’s relationship.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Katy M.
