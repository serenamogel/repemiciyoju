But I shan’t miss my wimple!"</p><p>The 74-year-old star has carved out a very successful acting career starting back in 1983 when she appeared in the comedy-drama Meantime. Then her next significant role came in the form of the blockbuster movie Matilda in 1996.</p><p>Based on the Roald Dahl novel of the same name, Matilda follows a young genius who discovers she has a magical ability that she uses against her mean family and an 'evil' teacher.</p><p><b><i>Pam Ferris as Miss Trunchbull:</i></b></p><p>Starring alongside Hollywood icon Danny Di Vito (Mr. Wormwood), Pam played the part of the ruthless Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.</p><p>Trunchbull was a villain and had a nasty streak when it came down to caring for the pupils at her school.</p><p>She would torment children and we all remember the scene where she made Bruce Bogtrotter eat a whole chocolate cake in front of the school.</p><p>In the movie, Ferris looks worlds away from her Call the Midwife role as she wears a military-style uniform, her hair slicked back and sports a very scary smile.</p><p>Fans of TV comedy dramas will know Pam as Ma Larkin in The Darling Buds of May who was married to Pop Larkin played by <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Only Fools and Horses</a> star David Jason.

Fans will remember the scene where Roger's character pays a visit to William Thacker’s travel book shop, only to pester him about non-fiction novels.</p><p>He has also appeared in several TV series including Doctors, The Bill and Doc Martin, and also starred in BBC One drama, The Diary of Anne Frank.</p><p>The pair tied the knot in 1986 and now reside in Elham, Kent. Speaking to The Guardian back in 2012 about her decision to get married in her late 30s and not have children, Pam said: "I was obsessed with work in my youth. It's why I didn't get married until I was 38 and the reason I didn't have kids."</p><p><b>Do you have a story you think we should be covering?
