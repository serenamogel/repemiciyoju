The people of <a href=# title="Ultra Megalopolis">Ultra Megalopolis</a> attempted to gain control of Necrozma in order to recreate the light it shares. This injured Necrozma, causing it to become aggressive, transforming its body into a black prism-like shape, and putting the Pokémon in constant pain, seeking out the light that it once had. According to <a href=# title="Professor Kukui">Professor Kukui</a>, pieces of its body were chipped off and scattered creating the <a href=# title=Z-Crystal>Z-Crystals</a> and <a href=# title="Sparkling Stone">Sparkling Stones</a> that are used to form <a href=# title=Z-Ring>Z-Rings</a> and <a href=# title="Z-Power Ring">Z-Power Rings</a> found in Alola.</p><p>Necrozma had attempted to recover this stolen light in Ultra Megalopolis and return to its original state, resulting in Ultra Megalopolis being shrouded in darkness. Necrozma was locked up in <a href=# title="Megalo Tower">Megalo Tower</a> for its violence, preventing it from escaping.</p><p>Necrozma, looking to devour Alola's light, had made its way into the region and putting it into darkness.

Lusamine warns Lillie to stay away from the monster, with Necrozma reaching through the Ultra Wormhole and making its way into Alola.

As a form of retreat, Necrozma summons more Ultra Wormholes across the Alola region, unleashing multiple <a href=# title="Ultra Beast">Ultra Beasts</a> and alerting the region's <a href=# title="Guardian deities">guardians</a>. Necrozma returns into Ultra Megalopolis and attempts to revert back into its original state. Horrified at the events that just occurred, the group meets the Ultra Recon Squad, who provide information on where Necrozma had run off to and what should be done.

Necrozma is engulfed with <a href=# title=Z-Power>Z-Power</a>, illuminated by a yellow aura which raises all of its <a href=# title=Stat>stats</a>.

The weakened Necrozma is found in a crater, and seeks light, leaving the player the option to choose to activate a battle with a higher catch rate than it had in Sun and Moon.
