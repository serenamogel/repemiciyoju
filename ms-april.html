She apparently blew up at Crawford at least three times a day while he was there, as found out during the outdoor class with him. However, she is never seen losing her temper at any point during the player's time at school. It is probable that Ms. April has gotten angry during the year at some point, however, because a student in Mr. Kincaid's class warns the player about her temper.</p><p>Sometime after the graduation, she asks the player to catch a wild <a href=# title="Pachirisu (Pokémon)">Pachirisu</a> that had made its home in the school and is bothering the students (if the player did not choose Pachirisu as their initial partner). This proves to be a challenge, owing to the fact that there are lots of Pachirisu dolls within the school to serve as decoys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4LAb6ugqamipA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corn-chowder-recipe.html><span>←</span><span>Corn Chowder</span></a>
