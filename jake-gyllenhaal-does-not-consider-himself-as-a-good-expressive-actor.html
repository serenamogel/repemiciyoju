Bush parody and gags about the first iPhone. The singer also uploaded a photo from back then, in which he was seen donning a wig and a frock and screaming out a song.</p><p>“Yeah. There I am in full drag, performing a Dream Girls song to promote a film in which I portrayed a homosexual cowboy.

He wasn’t even sure he’d remember how to host. He did say, though, that being there seemed like everything was suddenly returning.&nbsp;The singer sang a dramatic performance of Celine Dion’s It’s All Coming Back to Me Now with Chloe Fineman, Ego Nwodim, and Cecily Strong backing her up.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmqOVYrS6uMuepaGZkaF6pbvErGSnp6RisLC60qKbnqpdnbauv8SlnWaZo2KubrPOqJtmnailv6a%2F0qKtnmWRmMGwvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./discussion-on-the-level-of-romance-between-may-and-drew-seen-in-the-anime-19528.html><span>←</span><span>Discussion on the level of romance between May and Drew seen in the anime</span></a>
