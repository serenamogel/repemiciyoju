She knew from a young age that she wanted to be an actress. Her career took off with films such as Mad Max: Fury Road and the TV series "Big Little Lies." She also starred in and executive produced the series "High Fidelity." Kravitz is also a musician who has been in two bands. She married actor Karl Glusman in 2019, but filed for divorce the next year.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Parents</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zoë Isabella Kravitz was born on December 1, 1988, in Venice, California. Kravitz's parents are musician and actor Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet. Her stepfather is actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jason-momoa data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jason Momoa" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jason Momoa</a>. Kravitz has two younger half-siblings from Bonet and Momoa's relationship: Lola and Wolf.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kravitz's paternal grandmother, Roxie Roker, starred on the classic sitcom The Jeffersons. After Kravitz's parents split up when she was 2, she spent most of her early childhood surrounded by nature at her mother's home in the Topanga Canyon area of Los Angeles. Their television didn't have reception, but Kravitz was allowed to watch tapes on a VCR and could rent movies once a week.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At 11, Kravitz moved to live with her father in Miami. She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/arts/television/zoe-kravitz-high-fidelity.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a> in a 2020 interview, "I just wanted to feel normal, and the way my mother was raising me felt very abnormal, even though looking back, it was the coolest." But the move wasn't easy. "That was a massive change," she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/zoe-kravitz-naked-cover-story-746684/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> in 2018. "Going from this really quiet house in Topanga, just me and my mom, to my dad's life, which was very busy — lots of people, lots of assistants."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kravitz also felt isolated at school. "I went to a private school in Miami, surrounded by wealthy kids, mostly white," she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/zoe-kravitz-felt-like-a-freak-growing-up-around-mostly-white-kids/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a>. "I felt like a freak because my hair was different, and little kids would come up and say, 'Can I feel your hair?'" Kravitz and her father ended up relocating to New York City, where she enjoyed drama club and took classes at the Conservatory of Theatre Arts.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Eating Disorders</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In her last years of high school, Kravitz<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.complex.com/covers/zoe-kravitz-interview-2015-cover-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" developed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> developed</a> the eating disorders bulimia and anorexia.

"I'm okay now," she<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a30419740/zoe-kravitz-interview-high-fidelity-the-batman/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> said</a> in 2020. "But I am very vigilant. It's a disease, and I never let myself forget that."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Becoming an actress was a longtime goal for Kravitz.

Her debut was in the movie No Reservations (2007), in which she played a babysitter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kravitz's father has won multiple Grammy Awards and her mother came to fame as one of the Huxtable children on "The Cosby Show."

"My parents didn't become who they are because anything was handed to them, and they didn't raise a child who expected something to be handed to her, either," she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/zoe-kravitz-interview-teen-vogue-march-2016 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Teen Vogue" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Teen Vogue</a>.<u></u></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and TV Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kravitz has appeared in blockbuster films that include X-Men: First Class (2011), Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) and the Divergent series.

She took the lead role in "High Fidelity," which gender-switched the main character from the 1995 novel and 2000 movie (in which her mother appeared). Kravitz was an executive producer and got to write and direct for the show. "High Fidelity" debuted in February 2020 but, to Kravitz's disappointment, was canceled later in the year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kravitz is the director and co-writer for Pussy Island, a thriller starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/channing-tatum data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Channing Tatum" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Channing Tatum</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kravitz has fronted two bands.
