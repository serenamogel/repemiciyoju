They’re individually sized, so you won’t be tempted to eat more than a serving. They’re crispy-crunchy on the outside, and soft and squishy on the inside. They’re comforting and satisfying and, yes, if you don’t let them rest for a little while after they’ve emerged from the oven, they will burn the ever-loving shit out of the roof of your mouth—but that anticipation is part of the experience. (Also, part of the experience: Waiting for them to cook in the oven; please don’t cook your French bread pizzas in the microwave, people. Patience is a virtue!)</p><p>I’m on the record as <a href=#>a French bread pizza fan</a>, but I’d only had Stouffer’s. Stouffer’s French bread pizza is iconic. It’s a classic. But it also isn’t the best frozen French bread pizza at the grocery store. No one was more surprised by this than I was! There aren’t a lot of French bread pizzas at the grocery store, but I can say with confidence that these are the best.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

But when I sat down to taste them alongside other brands, I noticed some new things. The bread has a slightly odd, almost earthy flavor. And the sauce is so zesty it tends to overpower the toppings. Well, it turns out that zesty sauce sort of works when there’s only cheese on the pizza—and there’s a lot of cheese on this pizza. All that creaminess cuts the oregano-heavy flavor of the sauce. It’s good, but to be perfectly honest, if Red Baron made a plain cheese French bread pizza, Stouffer’s may not have made this list at all. Nuts, I know!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Albertsons</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best french bread pizzas" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BEST_FRENCH_BREAD_PIZZA_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Low-Cal</p><strong>Lean Cuisine French Bread Pepperoni</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>We’re not big on diet culture around here, but I have no qualms about recommending a diet product if it actually tastes good. Lean Cuisine’s pepperoni French bread pizza is surprisingly good (especially if you cook it in the oven rather than the microwave). The pepperoni is spicy and oily. The bread has a nice, hearty consistency. It’s a little light on cheese, but at just 300 calories, it still feels like a treat. It might not be the best French bread pizza you’ve ever had, but it’s the best French bread pizza if you’re watching your cals.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Ralphs</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best french bread pizza" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BEST_FRENCH_BREAD_PIZZA_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Pepperoni</p><strong>Red Baron French Bread Singles Pepperoni Pizzas</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Red Baron, you son of a bitch. I’ve spent years ignoring your French bread pizzas in the frozen aisle and I feel like a damn fool. The bread tastes like a warm baguette rather than a dried-out crouton. It has chew rather than the crumbly quality of Stouffer’s French bread. The cheese coverage is ample. The sauce is savory and pleasant, but it isn’t the dominant flavor. I was torn between this pepperoni pizza and Sabatasso’s (which we bought at Costco), but my colleague <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> confirmed that this was the stronger contender. This is an unbelievably satisfying snack or meal, but it’s not so meaty you feel weighed down after you eat it (Red Baron Three Meat was just too much for me). If you’ve been eating Stouffer’s pepperoni French bread pizza, try this one and tell me it isn’t the best French bread pizza going.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best french bread pizza" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BEST_FRENCH_BREAD_PIZZA_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Red Baron French Bread Singles Supreme Pizzas</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>We’ve made it to the best French bread pizza of them all, and this one truly has it all. Again, the bread is slightly thinner than Stouffer’s, but the quality and texture are just so much better. It’s so much more like actual French bread. The sauce is tomatoey, but it allows all the toppings to shine. You can really taste all of the components, including the pleasantly fennel-forward sausage bits and smoky pepperoni, which Jordan said tastes like pepperoni from a pizzeria. I was a dyed-in-the-wool Stouffer’s guy, but when it comes to the best French bread pizza, I’m a Red Baron convert.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Stouffer’s Deluxe French Bread Pizza, Stouffer’s Pepperoni French Bread Pizza, Sabatasso’s Pepperoni French Bread Pizza, Red Baron French Bread Singles Three Meat Pizzas</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite French bread pizza with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFustGosZ6mXZu%2FprrCoWSbqpWWsW68yLOxmmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-nelson-rock-singer-net-worth-218447.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Nelson Net Worth 2024</span></a>
