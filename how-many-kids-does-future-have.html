His most famous ex is <a href=#>the singer Ciara</a>; they <a href=#>share one son</a>, Future Wilburn Jr., <a href=#>born in 2014</a>.</p><p>Future had his first child, <a href=#>Jakobi Wilburn</a>, with a woman named Jessica Smith in 2002. His second child, <a href=#>Londyn Wilburn</a>, was born in 2009 to ex India J. The rapper had his third child, Prince Wilburn, with <a href=#>Brittni Mealy</a> in 2012. Then, after splitting up with Ciara, he had a son, Hendrix Wilburn, with then-girlfriend Joie Chavis, in 2018 (via <a href=#>USA Today</a>).</p><p>That brings the total to five children so far. Per <a href=#>The Blast</a>, Future seemingly confirmed that he only has children with five women in an Instagram Story in 2019, writing: "I have 5 wives BTW. Love them all to death."</p><p>However, rumors held that Future also had a sixth child named Kash with an anonymous woman in Arizona, born in 2014 or early 2015, per <a href=#>Ace Show Biz</a>. Future later confirmed Kash's existence with a <a href=#>tweet</a> in honor of Kash's mother for Mother's Day 2020.</p><p>Notably, Future also <a href=#>tweeted</a> about another child named Paris, whose mother he didn't mention by name. According to <a href=#>Vulture</a>, it's not&nbsp;totally clear if Future was revealing a seventh child with the tweet. However, he did&nbsp;shout out Paris in the midst of tweets about all his other kids, so we're going to count that as a confirmed child.</p><p>That's seven&nbsp;kids so far. But wait, it gets even more complicated!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xjbX90e8eormalkaPGbrfInapmnJ%2BawG6y1K2sq51dna63sY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./another-evil-2017.html><span>←</span><span>Another Evil movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</span></a>
