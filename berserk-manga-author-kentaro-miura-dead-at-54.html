The story is based on the characters: Guts, a mercenary, and Griffith, a leader of a band called “Band of the Hawk.”</p><p>The manga is published by Hakusensha and belongs to Dark Fantasy, Epic and Sword and Sorcery genre. With over 40 million copies, it is easily one of the best sellers of all time.</p><p>It has also been made into a television series and has a total of 24 episodes.

At the age of 10, in 1976, he made his first manga and named it “Miuranger.”</p><p>It was then published in his school magazine that gave Miura confidence to draw and create more mangas. In 1977, Miura made his second manga entitled Ken e no Michi, meaning The Way to the Sword.</p><p>While in high school, Miura got enrolled in the school’s art club and published his art in school booklets. Moreover, he attended the art college of Nihon University in 1985.</p><p>The same year Miura was nominated as the Best New Author in the Weekly Sohen Magazine.</p><p>In 1988, while Miura was still in college, he created a prototype of Berserk in Hakusensha’s Gekkan ComiComi. Moreover, the full serialization of <i>Berserk</i> also began in Hakusensha’s <i>Monthly Animal House</i> in 1989.</p><p>This ultimately became his most successful work.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=miuras-other-mangas></span>Miura’s Other Mangas<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Berserk gave him fame and fortune, Kentaro Miura has created several other Mangas.

However, he was inspired by several other Mangas as well.</p><p>He listed Manga like Fist of the North Star (1983), Violence Jack (1973), Guin Saga (1979), and movies like Disney Movies, Hellraiser series, and Paul Verhoeven movies as his inspiration.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=irreplaceable-loss></span>Irreplaceable Loss<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manga fans worldwide have mourned Kentaro’s death as an “irreplacable” loss to the Manga community. They regard his notable contributions in the Manga field as priceless and that no one can take his spot.</p><p>They have also termed the news of his death as “unexpected, tragic and heart-breaking.”</p><p>Although Miura is gone, Berserk and his other works will always keep him alive. Thank you, Miura; rest in peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqVp8CmvspmpJqml5Z6osHToaarZZuau7Wt0ahkpqGlp65usMSam2aZpGKCdXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./piicaro-net-worth-335056.html><span>←</span><span>Piicaro!
