He could have been in his Captain Kirk uniform battling a two-meter Gorn in the classic Star Trek episode “Arena” or perhaps sparring with his best friend and partner-in-law James Spader on Boston Legal as the ever-quotable Denny Crane. He could have even been cleaning up the streets of Los Angeles in the early 1980s as the uncompromising Sergeant T. J. Hooker.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>In 1987’s Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Shatner directed himself taking on a being that claimed to be God. In the following film, The Undiscovered Country, some would say that he topped that when he fought himself (actually the shapeshifting chameloid Martia, but where’s the fun in that?).</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Outside of his acting roles, you may have seen Shatner standing in front of a microphone, <a href=#>interpreting a classic</a> pop song with his distinctive spoken-word delivery. So far, he’s released eight studio albums and has plans for more.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>As an actor, author, screenwriter, producer, director, and singer, few can rival him in confronting such a wide range of opponents. But just how tall is the man who’s taken them all on?</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>How tall is William Shatner?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-10.26.21-AM.png><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The 90-year old Canadian is set to be the oldest person to travel into space in October 2021. He’ll follow Jeff Bezos to a suborbital height of 66 miles above Earth as a guest of Blue Origin aboard the New Shepard NS-18. The veteran actor has already joked that he hopes he won’t be <a href=#>joined by a gremlin on his trip</a>, a reference to the 1963 episode of The Twilight Zone he starred in called “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.”</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>Instead, Shatner will be joined by Blue Origin’s vice president of Mission and Flight Operations, a former NASA engineer, and the co-founder of a clinical research software company.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>As for the suit size Captain Kirk will be wearing, the consensus is that William Shatner’s <a href=#>peak height was 5’ 9”</a>, although he now comes in at 5’ 7½” tall.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Shatner’s height has been the subject of some debate for over half a century. Star Trek producer Bob Justman once suggested that the actor wore lifts aboard the Enterprise to achieve his advertised height of 5’ 11”.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>When Shatner met Mike Tyson, he is said to have asked the former world heavyweight champion his height. When Tyson told him he was 5’ 10”, <strong>Shatner</strong> replied that that was his height, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXamurbiMoqpmr5mhuaqtzGaqoZmko7Kzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./enemies-of-the-state-movie-review-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Enemies of the State movie review (2021)</span></a>
