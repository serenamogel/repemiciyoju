When did Little Debbie grow up and get so multitalented?</h2><p>First of all, I am very sorry Debbie (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she is a real person, you guys</a>) for ever doubting your wide range of sweet-making skills in this, 2023, the year of our Barbie movie. But let’s talk ice cream. According to Hudsonville, the company that makes Little Debbie ice cream, the Chocolate Christmas Tree Cakes Ice Cream is going to consist of chocolate ice cream with chocolate cake pieces and holiday-colored sprinkles, which makes sense because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Debbie Chocolate Christmas Tree Cakes</a> are just that: chocolate Christmas tree-shaped cakes with sprinkles on them. The Cherry Cordials Ice Cream will be cherry ice cream with cookie pieces, chocolate flakes, and a cherry ribbon, which again makes sense, as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Debbie Cherry Cordials</a> are a vanilla cookie sandwich filled with cherry creme and coated in a layer of fudge. I don’t know about you but to me it’s giving Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia plus vanilla cookie pieces, and I am here for it. They are also bringing back the popular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Debbie Christmas Tree Cakes</a> Ice Cream, which is white cake-flavored ice cream with yellow cake pieces, green sugar sprinkles, and red frosting ribbons. YUM!</p><p>As for how excited we need to be, I would say pretty darn excited. These are all available for a limited time at Walmart locations nationwide for around $2.88 a pint. And Debbie, if you are reading this, even though you are older than me and quite successful and this means nothing to you, I’m proud of you. Way to girlboss your way into the holiday ice cream realm. Little Debbie, you are a big inspiration to us all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKSZqcGtsYydnJuamZp6qq%2FEZpqrnZGieq%2Bx1madpZmmpL%2B0eceoo6Kcka56p7jAr6arq12jsri%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./has-season-32-finalist-sasha-farber-ever-won-dancing-with-the-stars.html><span>←</span><span>Has season 32 finalist Sasha Farber ever won Dancing With The Stars?</span></a>
