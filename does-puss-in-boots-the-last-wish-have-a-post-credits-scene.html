It is the sequel to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Puss in Boots</a>, which was released in 2011. If you can cast your mind back to 2004, you might recall that the character of Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) was introduced in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek 2</a> and that he is a part of that franchise.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=704 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>The film follows our main cat Puss in Boots as he is made to realize that he has used up eight of his nine lives. Helped (and sometimes hindered) by Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and other members of the fairy tale community, he journeys to find the Last Wish so he can wish back his eight lost lives and continue to live as a fearless outlaw. With the interactive animation being made available to stream on Netflix back in July, some folks who have not yet watched the feature might be wondering whether the film had a post-credits scene back during its theatrical run. So, let’s take a look at the film and reveal whether or not the post-credits scene was as magical as one film buff can imagine.</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-post-credits-scene-in-puss-in-boots-the-last-wish data-injectable=false>Is there a post-credits scene in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Puss-in-Boots-The-Last-Wish-Sword.jpg><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish ends in such a way that does not necessarily suggest that the movie will have a post-credits scene. Kitty, Puss, and Perrito (Harvey Guillén) manage to defeat the evil “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney), with Puss giving up the Last Wish to be content with Kitty. The trio end the film by sailing off on a ship and heading towards a fresh-faced adventure.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Whether the film has a post-credits scene is up for debate, as there is no extra scene where any character teases the next film, or a scene where Puss in Boots explained what happened in the movie to Donkey, or anything like that. Instead, if you did happen to stay until the end of the credits, you likely heard the voice of Puss in Boots pay an homage to Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and then questioned why you even stayed in the theater.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>It is not as if the film needed a post-credits scene, as the ending of the film manages to wrap up the story well and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set up the next entry</a> in the Shrek franchise. However, folks that did stick around for the end of the credits surely did so to humbly watch the names of all the people who worked on the film, including all of the brilliant animators. Or, you might have just stayed to hear the sultry tones of Antonio Banderas one last time before leaving the theater.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>If you missed Puss in Boots: The Last Wish while it was in theaters, you can happily stream the animation now over on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2K9tr%2FSZqCnZZKkvLW%2FjK2fnmWclsC1edaiqqFlmJbDpnnAZqeoq6RisLOxw6KrrGWjmLKvsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cory-la-quay-net-worth-136503.html><span>←</span><span>Cory La Quay Net Worth</span></a>
