Faith Martin is one of just three women who made it to the Hometown Dates on the very first season of The Golden Bachelor. The women vying for Gerry Turner’s heart, as well as the viewers who have been following along, were all surprised to learn there would only be three, and not four, Hometown Dates. Robert Mills explained why that was recently, and while it makes sense, we can add that to one of the things we’re hoping will change when The Golden Bachelor returns for another season.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Does GYATT Stand For On Tiktok?

Modern smartphones with high resolution displays and complex interfaces would not exist if the available CPU and GPU processing power hadn't advanced as much as it has.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Taylor Swift defends fan from aggressive security guard at Philadelphia concert</h2><time>Aug 1, 2024</time>

And contrary to what others might assume, she doesn't mind the transformation. She's not afraid of aging—on-screen or in real life. How do they make Rebecca look old on This Is Us? The team applied prosthetics to Moore's hands to “mimic more of that arthritic look,” Hay explains.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/19/>← Prev Page</a>
