Nike has dominated the NBA shoe sneaker market for decades. But there is a changing trend as new players are entering the market. Chinese brand ANTA has signed a multi-million dollar deal with <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kyrie Irving</a> this summer. It’s now New Balance that is catching the headlines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Forbes, New Balance is worth over $4.4 billion and they have signed Darius in a continued trend of high-profile athlete signings.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Garland ditches Nike for New Balance&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>NBA analyst Nick DePaula tweeted that Darius has officially signed a multi-year shoe deal with New Balance. It’s a bold move considering Nike’s massive market capitalization of $168.962 billion, which is far more than New Balance. New Balance is carving its own space in the NBA and has signed with several other high-profile players.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It is a dream to become a part of the New Balance brand,” <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said Darius about the deal</a>. “New Balance is a family brand and it felt that way from the first conversation. The brand’s commitment to individuality and their respect for athletes to be themselves is something I deeply respect,” he added. It’s still a close-knit group as compared to other sportswear giants.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>New Balance is re-emerging in the NBA&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>“The fun guy” <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kawhi</a> has a successful partnership with New Balance. New Balance announced a multiyear agreement to become an official marketing partner of the NBA when they signed Kawhi to re-emerge in the NBA. New Balance’s ‘We Got Now’ global brand campaign with Leonard was a huge success.&nbsp;He <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>wore his debut signature shoes</a> in his first All-Star game in 2020. The ‘KAWHI 4’ is set to be released in January 2024.</p><p><span>Other notable players are <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jamal Murray</a>, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dejounte Murray</a>, Darius Bazley, Aaron Nesmith, Tyrese Maxey, and Cameron Brink, who have signed with New Balance.&nbsp;</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-hate-wearing-what-my-opponent-is-wearing-eugenie-bouchard-reveals-reason-behind-signing-with-new-balance-wta-tennis-news?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210207165738/GettyImages-1160105201-472x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">“Hate Wearing What My Opponent Is Wearing”: Eugenie Bouchard Reveals Reason Behind Signing With New Balance</p></a><p>New Balance has come a long way, dating back to the brand formation in 1906. The brand is notably gaining a lot of popularity, as more people are gravitating towards the brand re-positioning. The brand is slowly expanding in the professional leagues and it’s the right time to hop on for young stars in the NBA.</p><p><strong>Watch this story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“Bam Adebayo humbles expectations on Victor Wembanyama after crushing Spurs rookie with 19-point comeback”</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Kaq56fn6fGcLrBmmanmpFirqTAyK%2BcZpqRqLimwMGao6VlnprEtHnNoqKeZZSewaS0yKeeZqeemnqpwc2dqZ6cXai2ucDYZpyin5ipeqO1y6WgqKZdo7avsYyhrKecopqxbr%2FIsauyZaSsvG65yKWjoqeeYsSwvtOhZJynXZmus7XUrGSgmaKhrq%2BwjJucnKedmsBuusSwZJuZnJa7pLGMm5ico5WZeqa1xqGrZqaSlnq0wMCrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cho-kyu-hyun.html><span>←</span><span>Cho Kyu Hyun Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
