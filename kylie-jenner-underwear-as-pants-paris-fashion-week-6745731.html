To safeguard against the seasonal chill, Jenner layered with an oversized gray wool coat and black heeled boots.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reality star's awe-shocking fashion statement *almost* distracted us from her new haircut. Overnight, Kylie seemingly chopped off signature long hair and debuted a shoulder-grazing bob the next morning. She styled her shorter locks in loose waves with a middle part, and finished off her glam with over-lined nude lips and sculpted brows.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What can we say?
