I don’t give a s**t about putting her on Vanderpump Rules.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After Lala and Randall’s engagement ended in 2021, the movie director was hit with numerous abuse and fraud allegations. In a bombshell exposé published by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LA Times</a> in June 2022, Randall was accused of offering actresses work in exchange for sex, among other troubling claims. Randall has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denied the numerous allegations</a> of sexual misconduct.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>During an interview on&nbsp;The View in June 2023, Lala admitted that she was “blindsided” by the allegations against her ex. “Anything that he’s done, I am separate from that. We parallel parent,” she explained. “Although we share a child, I’m not going to answer for his mistakes. I was completely blindsided,” Had I known who he was, number one, I wouldn’t have given him the time of day. Number two, I wouldn’t have had a baby with him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Speaking of baby number two, Lala recently told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cosmopolitan</a> that she’s working to give Ocean a younger sibling via IUI. “I will not gamble on me having my child,” she said. “I just don’t think that finding a partner and falling in love with someone has anything to do with bringing a child into the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZuupMCOr5innJWnvba5z2aprqSVqHqtrcuaZKSdnql6tK3YrGScp12lrrOxza2gp59drLa1tIyer2aqkaOxorjLZpympZWpwW610maYZqaZnLW1ucCrnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derek-harper-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Derek Harper Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
