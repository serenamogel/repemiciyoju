In my 40 years of insatiably reviewing restaurants, I learned to love sea urchin, eat live shrimp, and never hesitated when they passed the deep fried-spiders around. This one, admittedly, made me a tad squeamish.</p><p>Once committed, however, to rendering the official verdict on the first restaurant dish made from human protein—unless you count Sweeney Todd—I ran into a little snag called the New York Health Department. After a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>story</a> in yesterday’s New York Post, they’ve apparently forbidden the chef from not only making his breast milk cheese in the restaurant, but having it on Klee’s premises, much less serving it.</p><p>It’s the unexpected texture that’s so off-putting. Strangely soft, bouncy, like panna cotta.</p><p>So I made a few calls and a secured some of Angerer’s private stash, the excess “liquid gold” his breast-feeding wife and business partner Lori Mason had stored in their tiny home freezer. Nibbling fresh goat cheese and cow’s milk ricotta while I waited for the underground manna to arrive, I read about the human cheese’s genesis on the Austrian-born Angerer’s <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>blog</a>.</p><p>After tasting his wife’s milk from its natural vessel—“I was breastfed myself so I have that taste for it"—his mind went immediately to <i>fromage</i>. A little rennet. A clean cloth. Some aging. Simple, like any cheese. “It’s not like I was making Reblochon,” he wrote. “That would be trickier.”</p><p>His confession drew fans and bitter attacks on his blog. He was even accused of cannibalism.</p><p>That ultimate taboo in my head, the cheese arrives. I contemplate the tiny cream-colored square—doll size, barely enough to satisfy Minnie Mouse. It rides in on two house-made pickle rounds nesting on a thin slice of bread. I take… a bite. <i>Eeeeew!</i></p><p>Surprise. It’s not the flavor that shocks me—indeed, it is quite bland, slightly sweet, the mild taste overwhelmed by the accompanying apricot preserves and a sprinkle of paprika. It’s the unexpected texture that’s so off-putting. Strangely soft, bouncy, like panna cotta.</p><p>Of course, Angerer’s ultimate critic is the food source itself. He wanted his wife to try her cheese, he tells me when I call him after my human lunch. “I gave her a taste but I didn’t tell her what it was.” And she liked it. “Well, we had a bottle of Riesling,” he adds, “and it worked very well with that.”</p><p>There’s room for experimentation: His wife is a vegetarian. If she ate meat, her cheese would have a different flavor, we agreed. The chef has also tried coating his human cheese in porcini mushroom dust with a burned onion chutney, or rolling it into a caramelized pumpkin cheeseball.</p><p>I do not think we will soon be lining up for breast-milk ricotta at Zabar’s. But if there is a reward for inspired recycling, toque’s off to the adventurous chef.</p><p><b>Plus:</b> <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Check out Hungry Beast, for more news on the latest restaurants, hot chefs, and tasty recipes</a>.</p><p><i>A New York restaurant critic for 40 years and author of seven books (two bestselling novels, a sex guide and a memoir: </i><a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess</a><i>), Gael Greene’s reviews and archives can be found at her <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Web site</a>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmV%2BcXuPbGZpcV%2BXv6at0q1kpqGcoHqktMSeqp4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fractal-design-core-1000-how-little-is-too-little.html><span>←</span><span>Assembling the Fractal Design Core 1000</span></a>
