Benjamin reuinted with director F. Gary Gray (who shot numerous music videos for songs from Outkast’s seminal album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik) to play the role of Dabu, a trigger-happy, tea-loving gangster, and he’s a hilarious bright spot in an average movie.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dispatches from Elsewhere</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=833 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Segel’s baby</a> is a fictionalized retelling of a real life art installation/alternate reality game called The Jejune Institute, which in real life ran for three years in San Francisco. The series is set in Philadelphia, and follows the lives of a group of people who are drawn into what seems like a whimsical puzzle, but ends up being a complete maze of mystery. Benjamin is in a leading role as Fredwynn, a hyper-paranoid, hyper-intelligent player, and he’s excellent in this weird yet wonderful experimental show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Charlotte’s Web (2006)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Benjamin only has a small part in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">famous kid’s film</a> about animals banding together to save each other, but he is excellent in his minimal screentime as Elwyn the Crow, showing a penchant for voice acting that can only come with years of standing behind a microphone in a recording studio. A fun, cute classic for all the family to enjoy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Showing Up</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Indie darling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A24 have another understated gem</a> in their arsenal with Showing Up, which follows the life of a sculptor as she prepares for a show and nurses a pigeon back to health, all while dealing with her volatile personal relationships. Benjamin plays Eric, the man who works the kiln at the college where the main character, Lizzie, works. His understated and subtle performance is perfect for the movie, which moves slowly but methodically and profoundly.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Four Brothers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Benjamin is one of the four leads in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">violent revenge movie</a> about a quartet of adopted brothers who hunt down a gangster that they believed killed their mother. Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, and Garrett Hedlund are the other three siblings, and while Four Brothers might not be winning any Oscars, its high octane action makes it a fun watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Shield</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>The Outkast rapper only appeared in a couple of episodes of this acclaimed series about corrupt cops, but he was magnetic as Robert Huggins, the local comic book store owner turned politician (his episodes were four seasons apart). He showed he belonged on such a well regarded production with an assured and believable performance, and was one of the best guest stars in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series that’s full of them</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Idlewild</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Benjamin was credited under his stage name of André 3000 in this historical musical drama about a fictional duke joint in 1930s America. He starred alongside his musical partner Big Boi, and both deliver excellent performances in an unfocused film that has some astounding moments of brilliance. Even if the movie itself is middling, the soundtrack (written by its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">legendary leads</a>) is worth watching for.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Class of 3000</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Class of 3000 is Benjamin’s passion project. The talented star created, writes, and stars in this animated musical show about a performing arts school in Atlanta. He voices Sunny Bridges, also known as Lil D, a famed teacher at the school. Although it was eventually cancelled, the series nabbed an Emmy and had plenty of critical acclaim in its time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>American Crime</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>Benjamin appeared in a majority of episodes in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">well acclaimed second season</a> of this anthology series, which follows a different crime per season. The storyline the rapper was involved in follows two star basketball players who are accused of sexually assaulting a male classmate then posting pictures of the crime to a website. The rapper plays the father of one of the offenders, and tackles a hard role well.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Battle in Seattle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=false>This fictionalized retelling of an anti-WTO protest that erupted in Seattle gets a bit bogged down in the detail at points, but it has a powerful message that is communicated well. Benjamin plays Django, a disaffected protestor who bites off more than he can chew, and really makes you empathize with his character, even when he doesn’t make the best decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sur7DRnmRsaGBlwG6uxKyrZqWfq7amv4yapZ1lpKt6tLTOsKpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sigrid-thornton.html><span>←</span><span>Sigrid Thornton Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
